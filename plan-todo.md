# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03ef81b6-71ea-4ea5-8c82-3ca4943f8117)

- Determine what LLM to choose
- Determine what environment to work in (do we need access to sol or can we just do it locally/colab)
- Implement ReAct with the LLM
- Determine how to use CoT_SC (exactly what it is and think about practicality (how many reasoning traces, how to determine which to choose, etc.))
- Determine a more detailed framework of how CoT_SC works with ReAct
- Implement CoT_SC with ReAct: Updated ReAct.
