Qadir on when he participated in an attack on a radar station located on western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula?\nThought 1: I need to search for \"Iqbal F. Qadir\" and \"attack on a radar station located on western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula\" to find information about what Iqbal F. Qadir was on during the attack.\nAction 1: Search[Iqbal F. Qadir]\nObservation 1: Iqbal Fazl Quadir (Urdu: \u0627\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631) HI(M), TI(M), SBt, TQA, (died 19 October 2020) was a three-star rank admiral in the Pakistan Navy, diplomat and a defence analyst. He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Iqbal F. Qadir participated in an attack on a radar station in Dwarka, India. It also states he was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England and served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant. I need to find what he was \"on\" during the attack. The observation mentions he was part of a flotilla. I will look for information about this flotilla.\nAction 2: Lookup[flotilla]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 3) He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India..\nThought 3: The observation states he was part of a flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. I need to find out what ship or vessel he was on. The previous observation mentioned he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant. I will check if that was the ship he was on during the attack.\nAction 3: Lookup[PNS Shamsher]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 1) Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1].\nThought 4: The observation states he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant, but it doesn't explicitly say he was on the PNS Shamsher during the attack on the radar station. The mention of \"flotilla\" suggests a group of ships. I need to find out which ship was part of that flotilla and on which Iqbal F. Qadir was present. I will search for \"Dwarka attack Pakistan Navy flotilla\" to get more context.\nAction 4: Search[Dwarka\nObservation 4: Invalid action: search[Dwarka\nThought 5: The previous action was invalid because it was incomplete. I need to search for \"Dwarka attack Pakistan Navy flotilla\".\nAction 5: Search[Dwarka attack Pakistan Navy flotilla]\nObservation 5: Could not find Dwarka attack Pakistan Navy flotilla. Similar: ['Pakistan Navy', 'Indo-Pakistani war of 1965', 'Indian Navy', 'Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971', 'History of the Indian Navy'].\nThought 6: I need to find information about the attack on the radar station in Dwarka. The previous search for \"Dwarka attack Pakistan Navy flotilla\" failed. I will try searching for \"Dwarka radar station attack\" to get more general information about the event, and then look for Iqbal F. Qadir's role in it.\nAction 6: Search[Dwarka radar station attack]\nObservation 6: Could not find Dwarka radar station attack. Similar: ['Operation Dwarka', 'Integrated Coastal Surveillance System (redirect from Coastal Surveillance Radar System)', 'Iqbal F. Qadir', 'Indira Gandhi International Airport (redirect from Palam Air Force Station)', 'S. M. Anwar'].\nThought 7: The observation suggests \"Operation Dwarka\". This seems like a relevant event. I will search for \"Operation Dwarka\" to find out more details about the attack and Iqbal F. Qadir's involvement.\nAction 7: Search[Operation Dwarka]\nObservation 7: Operation Dwarka was a naval operation by the Pakistan Navy to attack the Indian coastal town of Dwarka on 7 and 8 September 1965. This instance was the first engagement by the Pakistan Navy in any of the Indo-Pakistan wars.[a]. As the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 broke out between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, the armies and air forces of both nations were involved in intense fighting in the regions of Punjab and Kashmir. To relieve pressure on the southern front, Pakistan decided to send its navy to launch a strike on the Indian coast. The primary objective of the attack ostensibly was to destroy the radar station at Dwarka which was believed by Pakistani naval intelligence to have a Huff-Duff beacon to guide Indian bombers.[2] Pakistani high command also hoped to divert the operations of the Indian Air Force away from the north..\n",

Wilmslow derives its name from Old English W\u012bghelmes hl\u0101w, meaning \"mound of a man called W\u012bghelm.\"[4]. Much about the local Iron Age history of Wilmslow was uncovered with the discovery of Lindow Man, in Lindow Moss.\nThought 4: The search for \"Wilmslow\" did not mention the Wilmslow Show or any school where it might be held.

The previous search for \"Wilmslow Show\" suggested similar entities like \"Matty Healy\", \"The 1975\", and \"George Daniel\". This indicates that the \"Wilmslow Show\" might be related to a band or a specific performance rather than a recurring event held at a fixed school.

It can be exhilarating, especially when it gets everybody on their feet.\nThought 7: The soundtrack for Hercules (1997) was written by Alan Menken and David Zippel.

Then, for each of those actors, I need to check if they have also starred in Holby City, Doctor Strange, the Bourne Ultimatum, and Zero Dark Thirty. Finally, I will identify the actor who meets all these criteria. I will start by searching for \"Luc Deveraux\" to find information about the Universal Soldier franchise and its actors.\nAction 1: Search[Luc Deveraux]\nObservation 1: Luc Deveraux is the title character and protagonist of the Universal Soldier film series. He is most famously portrayed by Belgian actor and martial artist Jean-Claude Van Damme in Universal Soldier (1992) and its sequels, Universal Soldier: The Return (1999), Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning (2012). The character is also portrayed by Matt Battaglia in the 1998 direct-to-video sequels Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms and Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business.. He first appeared in Universal Soldier as \"GR44\" - depicted as a deceased Vietnam War soldier, who is reanimated in a secret government project to become a Universal Soldier or UniSol. He and other UniSols serve as remote-controlled superhuman soldiers sent into the most dangerous situations..\nThought 2: The actors who have played Luc Deveraux are Jean-Claude Van Damme and Matt Battaglia. I need to check if either of them has starred in Holby City, Doctor Strange, the Bourne Ultimatum, and Zero Dark Thirty. I will start with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Born and raised in Brussels, his father enrolled him in a Shotokan karate school at the age of ten, which led Van Damme to hold the rank of 2nd-dan black belt in karate, and compete in several karate and kickboxing competitions. As a teenager, he won the middleweight championship of the European Professional Karate Association in 1979 and the Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in 1978. With the desire of becoming an actor in Hollywood, he moved to the United States in 1982, where he worked on several films, until he got his break as the lead in the martial arts film Bloodsport (1988)..\nThought 3: The current observation is about Jean-Claude Van Damme's background and his role in Bloodsport. It does not mention Holby City, Doctor Strange, the Bourne Ultimatum, or Zero Dark Thirty. I need to look for information about his other movie roles. I will use the Lookup action to find mentions of these movies in relation to Jean-Claude Van Damme. I'll start with \"Holby City\".\nAction 3: Lookup[Holby City]\nObservation\nObservation 3: Invalid action: lookup[Holby City]\nObservation\nThought 4: The previous lookup action for \"Holby City\" failed because it was not in the current passage.
