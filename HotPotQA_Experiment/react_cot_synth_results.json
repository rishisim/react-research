He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 3: The previous search mentioned that Iqbal F. Qadir was part of a flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. It also states he was trained in signals and served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant. The question asks what he was \"on\" during the attack. Being part of a flotilla implies he was on a ship.

The question asks what he was \"on\". Being part of a flotilla means he was on a ship within that flotilla. The observation doesn't explicitly name the ship. I need to find out which ship he was on. I will search for \"Dwarka attack flotilla\" or \"Pakistan Navy ships Dwarka attack\".\nAction 5: Search[Dwarka attack flotilla]\nObservation 5: Could not find Dwarka attack flotilla. Similar: ['Iqbal F.

The similar results suggest looking into naval battles and the history of the Indian Navy. Since the previous observation mentioned he was part of a flotilla led by Cdre. (Commodore), I should try to find information about that specific flotilla or the ships involved in the Dwarka attack. I will try searching for \"Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka attack\".\nAction 6: Search[Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka\nObservation 6: Invalid action: search[Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka\nThought 7: The search term was too long and contained a space.

Qadir during this attack.\nAction 1: Search[attack on radar station Okhamandal Peninsula]\nObservation 1: Could not find attack on radar station Okhamandal Peninsula. Similar: ['Indian Rebellion of 1857 (category Commons category link is on Wikidata)'].\nThought 2: The search did not yield direct results. I will try searching for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" to get general information about the location and then look for any significant events or attacks that might have occurred there.\nAction 2: Search[Okhamandal Peninsula]\nObservation 2: Could not find Okhamandal Peninsula. Similar: ['Dwarka', 'Bet Dwarka', 'List of railway companies in India', 'Prant', 'Kingdom of Valabhi'].\nThought 3: The search for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" did not yield direct results.

Similar: ['Dwarka', 'Vadhel', 'Dwarkadhish Temple', 'Indian Rebellion of 1857', 'List of districts of Gujarat'].\nThought 4: The searches for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" and \"Okhamandal\" did not provide relevant information about an attack or Iqbal F. Qadir. It is possible the premise of the question is incorrect, or the information is not available through these searches. I will try searching for \"Iqbal F. Qadir\" to see if I can find any information about involvement in any attacks, which might indirectly lead to the radar station.\nAction 4: Search[Iqbal F.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: search[Iqbal F.\nThought 5: Qadir]\nAction 5: Search[Iqbal F.

He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 6: The observation mentions that Iqbal F. Quadir was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. Dwarka is likely the same location as Okhamandal Peninsula. The question asks what he was \"on\" when he participated in the attack. The observation states he was part of the \"flotilla\". I should confirm if \"flotilla\" is a type of vessel or a larger unit. The observation also states he was a \"three-star rank admiral\nAction 6: Lookup[flotilla]\nObservation 6: (Result 1 / 3) He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India..\nThought 7: The observation states that he was part of the \"flotilla\". While a flotilla is a small fleet of warships, the question asks what he was \"on\", implying a specific vessel. The text doesn't specify the type of vessel he was on within the flotilla. It mentions he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals. It also mentions he served as Lieutenant in PNS Shamsher. However, it doesn't explicitly state he was *on* PNS Shamsher during\nAction 7: the attack on Dwarka. I need to check if any other information can be extracted about his role or the vessel he was on.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the attack on Dwarka. I need to check if any other information can be extracted about his role or the vessel he was on.\n",

As of June 2025, the school has a pupil intake of 2,196 pupils, despite only having a school capacity of 1,977 pupils.[4]. Wilmslow High School was originally established as the co-educational Wilmslow County Grammar School in September 1960 with 900 pupils.[5] The new county grammar school was opened by Sir James Mountford, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, on 24 March 1961. A girls' grammar school was built on 14 acres (57,000\u00a0m2) of the former Colshaw Hall Farm, and situated on Dean Row Road. It opened in 1964 and housed 750 girls.\nThought 7: The observation mentions that Wilmslow High School was originally established as Wilmslow County Grammar School. The question asks for the designation of the school where the Wilmslow Show is held. While the observation doesn't explicitly state that the Wilmslow Show is held at Wilmslow High School, it's a strong possibility given the name and the previous searches. The original designation was \"Wilmslow County Grammar School\". I will assume this is the answer.\nAction 7: Finish[Wilmslow County Grammar School]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

Similar: [\"Matty Healy (redirect from Matty Healy's appearance on The Adam Friedland Show)\", 'Sarah Hadland', 'The 1975', 'George Daniel', 'Alderley Edge'].\nThought 2: The search result did not directly identify the school where the Wilmslow Show is held. It provided similar entities, one of which is \"Alderley Edge\". It's possible the Wilmslow Show is related to Alderley Edge, and I should investigate that.\nAction 2: Search[Alderley Edge]\nObservation 2: Alderley Edge is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England, 6 miles (10\u00a0km) north-west of Macclesfield and 12 miles (19\u00a0km) south of Manchester. It lies at the base of a wooded sandstone escarpment, The Edge, overlooking the Cheshire Plain. As of the 2021 census, its population was 4,777.. The village is known for its affluence, expensive homes and location within Cheshire's Golden Triangle.[2][3] Its cafes and designer shops attract Premier League footballers, actors and businesspeople,[4] making it one of the UK's most sought-after places to live outside London.[3]. The Alderley Edge area shows signs of occupation since the Mesolithic period, with flint tools found along its sandstone outcrop.\nThought 3: The observation for Alderley Edge does not mention the Wilmslow Show or any school associated with it. I need to go back to the search results for \"Wilmslow Show\" and consider other similar entities or try a different approach. Since the previous searches did not yield the answer, I will try searching for \"Wilmslow\" directly to see if it provides any context related to events or schools.\nAction 3: Search[Wilmslow]\nObservation 3: Wilmslow (/\u02c8w\u026almslo\u028a/ or /\u02c8w\u026amslo\u028a/) is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. It is 11 miles (18\u00a0km) south of Manchester. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 26,213 and the built up area had a population of 25,725.. Wilmslow derives its name from Old English W\u012bghelmes hl\u0101w, meaning \"mound of a man called W\u012bghelm.\"[4]. Much about the local Iron Age history of Wilmslow was uncovered with the discovery of Lindow Man, in Lindow Moss.\nThought 4: The observation for Wilmslow mentions its location and history but not the Wilmslow Show or any associated school. It seems the initial search and subsequent related searches did not provide the necessary information. Given the lack of progress, it's unlikely I can find the answer with further Wikipedia searches. I will indicate that the information is not available.\nAction 4: Finish[null]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

He started his relationship with the Royal Court Theatre under Stephen Daldry in 1995.

Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz stated that the Universal Soldier franchise \"is a rare series that takes more creative risks as it goes along\".[3]. Directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Richard Rothstein, Christopher Leitch, and Dean Devlin, it stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and Ally Walker.. In the first installment of the franchise, American soldier Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) finds that his superior officer, Andrew Scott (Lundgren), has turned violently deranged, and the two fight to the death during the Vietnam War.\nThought 3: The actors who played Luc Deveraux are Jean-Claude Van Damme and Matt Battaglia. Scott Adkins played a new protagonist named John in a later film, so he is not relevant to Luc Deveraux.

Born and raised in Brussels, his father enrolled him in a Shotokan karate school at the age of ten, which led Van Damme to hold the rank of 2nd-dan black belt in karate, and compete in several karate and kickboxing competitions. As a teenager, he won the middleweight championship of the European Professional Karate Association in 1979 and the Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in 1978.

It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom subsequently left the show.\nThought 7: \"Holby City\" is a British medical drama and does not mention Jean-Claude Van Damme. This suggests he did not star in it. I need to check the other movies for him. Since the previous searches for his filmography were not successful, I will try to search for \"Doctor Strange\" and see if Jean-Claude Van Damme is mentioned.

I need to find information about this war and identify the specific incident with the highest casualties and the captain responsible. I will start by searching for \"New Netherland Lenape war\".\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape war]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape war. Similar: ['Lenape', \"Kieft's War\", 'New Netherland', 'Pavonia, New Netherland', 'New York (state)'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape war\" did not yield direct results. However, the similar entities suggest \"Kieft's War\" might be relevant, which was a conflict between the Lenape and Dutch settlers in New Netherland. I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to gather information about it.\nAction 2: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 2: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 3: Kieft's War involved attacks on Lenape camps and massacres. The question asks about the attack that led to more casualties than any other incident. The observation states that Willem Kieft had ordered an attack without approval, and that Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred inhabitants. It also mentions that this precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. I need to determine if any specific attack is mentioned as having the highest casualties. The observation doesn't explicitly state which incident had the most casualties\nAction 3: Lookup[massacred]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 2) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 4: The observation mentions that Willem Kieft ordered an attack and that Dutch colonists massacred inhabitants. This implies Willem Kieft is the leader who ordered the attack. The question asks \"Which Captain launched the attack\". Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, which can be considered a leadership role akin to a captain in this context. The text states \"Willem Kieft... had ordered an attack\". This directly links him to launching the attack. I need to confirm if this attack\nAction 4: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 7) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 5: The observation states that Willem Kieft ordered an attack. The question asks which Captain launched the attack. Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, a leadership position. The text explicitly says he \"ordered an attack\". While it doesn't explicitly state this attack caused more casualties than any other, it describes massacres and waves of attacks on both sides, implying significant casualties. Given the information, Willem Kieft is the most likely answer as the person who initiated the conflict described.\nAction 5: Finish[Willem Kieft]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I will start by searching for information on conflicts between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population.\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape conflict]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape conflict. Similar: ['Lenape', 'New Netherland', 'Conquest of New Sweden', 'Kechemeche (category People from New Netherland)', 'Pavonia, New Netherland'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape conflict\" did not yield direct results. I need to find information about wars or conflicts between the settlers of New Netherland and the Lenape population. I will try searching for a more general term related to conflicts in New Netherland.\nAction 2: Search[New Netherland conflict]\nObservation 2: Could not find New Netherland conflict. Similar: ['Conquest of New Netherland', 'New Netherland', 'Pavonia, New Netherland', 'Netherlands (redirect from The netherland)', 'New Amsterdam'].\nThought 3: The search results are not directly answering the question about the specific incident with the most casualties. I need to look for a specific event that involved both New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population and resulted in significant casualties. The term \"Pavonia massacre\" might be relevant, as it refers to an incident where Dutch colonists attacked a Lenape settlement. I will search for this term.\nAction 3: Search[Pavonia massacre]\nObservation 3: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 4: The observation for \"Pavonia massacre\" does not mention the massacre itself or any details about it, only the history of Pavonia. I need to find information about the Pavonia massacre and who led the attack. I will try searching for \"Pavonia massacre casualties\" or \"attack on Pavonia\".\nAction 4: Search[Pavonia massacre attack]\nObservation 4: Could not find Pavonia massacre attack. Similar: ['Pavonia, New Netherland', 'Massacre at Corlears Hook', 'Pound Ridge massacre', \"Kieft's War (category Massacres of Native Americans)\", 'List of Indian massacres in North America'].\nThought 5: The previous search did not directly yield information about the attack or casualties. The similar results suggest \"Kieft's War\" might be relevant, as it often involved massacres. I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to see if it provides details about specific incidents and leaders.\nAction 5: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 5: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.

Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 6: Kieft's War involved attacks on Lenape camps and massacres. The war was initiated by Willem Kieft. The question asks which Captain launched the attack that led to more casualties. Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, which is a position of leadership equivalent to captain in this context, and he ordered the attack. I need to confirm if this war had the most casualties. However, the text states \"Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants,\nAction 6: Lookup[most casualties]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: The text mentions that Kieft's War involved massacres and attacks on both sides. However, it does not explicitly state that it resulted in more casualties than any other incident in the war between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population. Without further information to confirm this, I cannot definitively answer the question. The question asks for the captain who launched the attack with *more* casualties than *any other incident*.

I will try searching for \"Pavonia Massacre\" as this is a known historical event involving the Lenape and New Netherland settlers that resulted in significant casualties.\nAction 5: Search[Pavonia Massacre]\nObservation 5: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 6: The observation for Pavonia Massacre mentions European settlement and fur trade with the Lenape, but not the specific incident of the massacre or the captain responsible. It also does not mention casualties. I need to find information about the massacre itself and who launched it. I will look up \"Pavonia Massacre\" again to find more details, specifically about the attack and its leader.\nAction 6: Lookup[Pavonia Massacre]\nObservation 6: (Result 1 / 2) Historians differ on whether or not the massacre was Kieft's idea.[15][16] This is sometimes referred to as the Pavonia Massacre.[17] The same night also saw a similar if smaller attack in Manhattan, the Massacre at Corlears Hook.\nThought 7: The observation mentions \"Kieft's idea\" and \"Massacre at Corlears Hook\" as a similar attack. This suggests that Kieft might be the person responsible for the attack. I need to confirm if Kieft launched the attack and if it resulted in high casualties. I will search for \"Kieft\" in the context of the Pavonia Massacre.\nAction 7: Lookup[Kieft]\nObservation 7: (Result 1 / 9) These conflicts led to rising tensions and eventually an incident that started a series of raids and reprisals, known as Kieft's War.[12].\n",

First, I need to find out when \"Nightmares\" was released.\nAction 1: Search[Nightmares]\nObservation 1: A nightmare, also known as a bad dream,[1] is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically fear but also despair, anxiety, disgust or sadness. The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The previous search for \"Nightmares\" did not yield any information about a film with that title. I should try searching for \"Nightmare\" as a film title. It's possible the question meant \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" or a similar film.

It seems the term \"Nightmares\" might be too general or there isn't a prominent film solely titled \"Nightmares.\" I should try searching for films with \"Nightmare\" in their title that Emilio Estevez might have been in. Since the previous searches were not fruitful, I will try searching for Emilio Estevez's filmography to see if I can find a\nAction 3: Search[Emilio Estevez filmography]\nObservation 3: Could not find Emilio Estevez filmography.

However, it suggested related individuals. I will search for \"Emilio Estevez\" to get general information about his career, which might include film titles.\nAction 4: Search[Emilio Estevez]\nObservation 4: Emilio Estevez (/\u025b\u02c8m\u026alio\u028a \u025b\u02c8st\u0259v\u025bs/; born May 12, 1962) is an American actor and filmmaker. The son of actor Martin Sheen and the older brother of Charlie Sheen, he  made his film debut with an uncredited role in Badlands (1973). He later received his first credited appearance with a supporting role in the coming-of-age film Tex (1982).. Estevez gained mainstream recognition with a starring role in the drama film The Outsiders (1983), leading him to be associated with a group of young actors known as the \"Brat Pack.\" After starring in the films Nightmares (1983) and Repo Man (1984), Estevez had his breakout with starring roles in the commercially successful Brat Pack films The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985).\nThought 5: The observation states that Emilio Estevez starred in \"Nightmares (1983)\". The question asks for a film he starred in the same year as \"Nightmares\". Since he starred *in* \"Nightmares\" in 1983, I need to find another film he starred in that same year.

Prior to the tour, the band embarked on a series of promotional and festival performances, including Austin City Limits,[4] Glastonbury,[5] Lollapalooza,[6] and Rock in Rio.[7] Coldplay held concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well.[8] They became the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows,[9] popularising them in the live music industry.[10] According to Pollstar, the tour grossed over $181.3 million from 2.1 million tickets sold across 75 reported dates.[11]. After devoting the summer of 2011 to a promotional tour in Europe, the Americas and Africa,[12] the band announced the tour via their Twitter account in September 2011.\nThought 4: The observation for Mylo Xyloto Tour mentions that Coldplay were the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows, popularizing them.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician.

I will start by searching \"Blackzilians\".\nAction 1: Search[Blackzilians]\nObservation 1: The Blackzilians was a professional team of fighters in mixed martial arts, boxing, kickboxing, amateur wrestling and catch wrestling located in South Florida. The team had included former UFC champions Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, Eddie Alvarez and Kamaru Usman.. Owned by Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians, started when MMA fighters Jorge Santiago, Danillo Villefort, Yuri Villefort, and Gesias Cavalcante left American Top Team.[1] The name 'Blackzilians' was coined when Strikeforce Middleweight Danillo Villefort was looking through their management's website and pointed out to Robinson that every fighter (at the time) was Black or Brazilian.[2]. It was reported on September 20, 2018, that Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians founder, had died of a suspected heart attack.[3]. As of 2017, the Blackzilians as a gym is considered defunct.[4][5] Many of its members have left to join Combat Club, now Kill Cliff Fight Club (founded by Blackzilians trainers Henri Hooft and Greg Jones) which is considered a successor to the Blackzilians.[5].\nThought 2: The previous search for \"Blackzilians\" mentions former UFC champions Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, Eddie Alvarez and Kamaru Usman. It also mentions that the gym is defunct as of 2017. I need to find out which of these fighters (or any other fighter associated with Blackzilians) is currently competing in the Middleweight division of UFC. I will start by searching for Kamaru Usman.\nAction 2: Search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 2\nObservation 2: Invalid action: search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 2\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Blackzilians\" mentioned Kamaru Usman as a former UFC champion. I need to find out if he is currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. I will search for Kamaru Usman.\nAction 3: Search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 3: Kamarudeen Usman[1] (born May 11, 1987) is a Nigerian-American[9] professional mixed martial artist, former freestyle wrestler, and graduated folkstyle wrestler. He currently competes in the Welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former UFC Welterweight Champion. Usman is also The Ultimate Fighter 21 tournament winner. He is considered one of the greatest Welterweights of all time.[10][11][12][13] As of May 13, 2025, he is #5 in the UFC welterweight rankings.[14]. As a freestyle wrestler, Usman primarily competed at 84 kilograms (185\u00a0lb), and was a 2010 U.S.\nThought 4: Kamaru Usman currently competes in the Welterweight division, not the Middleweight division. I need to check the other fighters mentioned in the \"Blackzilians\" description to see if any of them are currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. The fighters mentioned are Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, and Eddie Alvarez. I will start by searching for Vitor Belfort.\nAction 4: Search[Vitor Belfort]\nObservation 4: V\u00edtor Vieira Belfort[4] (Portuguese pronunciation: [\u02c8vito\u0281 vi\u02c8ej\u027e\u0250 b\u025bw\u02c8f\u0254\u0281]; born 1 April 1977) is a Brazilian professional boxer and retired mixed martial artist who competed for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he fought in the Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, and Middleweight divisions. He is the UFC 12 Heavyweight Tournament Champion, as well as a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and Cage Rage World Light Heavyweight Champion. Known for his explosive knockout power, Belfort is tied for fifth for the most finishes in UFC history with 14.[5] Belfort also competed for MMA promotions Pride FC, Strikeforce, and Affliction.. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Belfort began training in boxing at the age of 12 under Claudio Coelho. Belfort later studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Carlson Gracie, who gave him his black belt.\nThought 5: Vitor Belfort competed in the Middleweight division of the UFC. The question asks which \"Blackzilians\" fighter is *currently* competing in the Middleweight division. Vitor Belfort is retired, so he is not currently competing. I need to check the remaining fighters: Rashad Evans and Eddie Alvarez. I will search for Rashad Evans.\nAction 5: Search[Rashad Evans]\nObservation 5: Rashad Evans (born September 25, 1979) is an American retired mixed martial artist who competed in the Light Heavyweight division. Evans started his professional MMA career in 2003, and was the Heavyweight winner of The Ultimate Fighter 2 in 2005. In 2008, Evans won the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, and in 2019, was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.. In present day, he serves on the UFC broadcasting team as a desk analyst[5] while also advocating for the health benefits of functional mushrooms through his company Umbo, co-founded alongside former NFL quarterback, Jake Plummer.[6]. Wrestling out of Niagara-Wheatfield High School in Sanborn, New York, Evans twice made it to the state finals tournament of New York by winning his weight class for his region, in which he received All-State honors both times.\nThought 6: Rashad Evans is retired and competes in the Welterweight division. I need to check Eddie Alvarez.\nAction 6: Search[Eddie Alvarez]\nObservation 6: Edward Alvarez[3] (born January 11, 1984) is an American professional mixed martial artist and bare-knuckle boxer who most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC.[4] He formerly competed in the Lightweight divisions of the UFC and Bellator MMA, where he was the UFC Lightweight Champion, and the inaugural and two-time Bellator Lightweight Champion. He also competed for the Japanese DREAM promotion, where he fought in their inaugural Lightweight Grand Prix, along with fighting in ONE FC, where he competed in their 2019 Lightweight World Grand Prix. Alvarez has also competed in EliteXC.. Alvarez is the first fighter to have won championships in both Bellator MMA and the UFC. He holds notable wins over former world champions Pat Curran, Michael Chandler, Shinya Aoki, Gilbert Melendez, Justin Gaethje, Anthony Pettis, Eduard Folayang, Patricky Freire and Rafael dos Anjos.\nThought 7: Eddie Alvarez competed in the Lightweight divisions of the UFC and Bellator MMA, and most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC. He is not currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. Since all the fighters mentioned in the initial search are either retired or not competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC, it's possible there isn't a \"Blackzilians\" fighter that fits the criteria. However, the initial search also stated that \"Many of its members have\nAction 7: Search[Blackzilians members Middleweight UFC]\nObservation 7: Could not find Blackzilians members Middleweight UFC.

This article about a location in the Mexican state of Sinaloa is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Villa Uni\u00f3n is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, but it doesn't state that the state was named after the town, or vice versa. I need to find out which Mexican state is referenced in the naming of Villa Uni\u00f3n. I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" and look for information about its naming origin.\nAction 2: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n]\nObservation 2: Villa Uni\u00f3n is a city in northwestern Argentina and the main settlement of Coronel Felipe Varela Department with a population of 12,263.. The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" yielded information about a city in Argentina, not the Mexican state. The original question is about a Mexican state. I need to re-focus my search on the \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" context and investigate the naming origin related to a Mexican state.

It is divided into 18 municipalities, and its capital city is Culiac\u00e1n Rosales.. It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast. To the west, Sinaloa faces Baja California Sur, across the Gulf of California.

I need to find out if there is a Mexican state named \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" or if \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" is named after a Mexican state.

The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 4: The current observation is about Villa Uni\u00f3n in Argentina, not Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa in Mexico.

In the hierarchy of Mexican administrative divisions, states are further divided into municipalities. Currently there are 2,462 municipalities in Mexico.. Although not formally a state, political reforms have enabled Mexico City (Spanish: Ciudad de M\u00e9xico), the capital city of the United Mexican States to have a federative entity status equivalent to that of the states since January 29, 2016..\nThought 6: The current observation lists the administrative divisions of Mexico but does not provide any information about a Mexican state named \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" or a state after which \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" is named.

I should start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then look for languages related to it, specifically those that are also related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent.\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, specifically mentioning Numidian language. The question asks for a language written with this script and related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages. Therefore, the language I am looking for is likely an ancient Berber language. I should search for languages related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and see if any are associated with the Liby\nAction 2: Search[Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages]\nObservation 2: Could not find Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages. Similar: ['Tugurt language', 'Ouargli language'].\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages\" did not yield direct results. However, it suggested \"Tugurt language\" and \"Ouargli language.\" These are likely related to the languages I'm looking for. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Berber script was used for Berber languages, I should investigate if Tugurt or Ouargli are related to the ancient varieties of Berber languages and if\nAction 3: Search[Ouargli language]\nObservation 3: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 4: The observation states that Ouargli is also known as Teggargrent, which is one of the languages mentioned in the question. It also mentions that speakers from Ouargla regard other varieties, including Tumzabt and Tugurt/Temacine, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This confirms that Ouargli (Teggargrent) and Tumzabt are closely related. The question also asks for a language traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-\nAction 4: Lookup[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The previous search for \"Libyco-Berber script\" did not yield further relevant information in the context of Ouargli. However, Observation 1 stated that the Libyco-Berber alphabet was used to write \"ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.\" Observation 3 confirmed that Ouargli (Teggargrent) is a Zenati Berber language and is closely related to Tumzabt. The question asks for a language traditionally written with the ancient Lib\nAction 5: Search[Numidian language]\nObservation 5: Numidian /n(j)u\u02d0\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259n/ was a language spoken in ancient Numidia. The script in which it was written, the Libyco-Berber alphabet (from which Tifinagh descended), has been almost fully deciphered and most characters (apart from a few exceptions restricted to specific areas) have known values. Libyco-Berber inscriptions are attested from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. As most surviving inscriptions are funerary steles with a simple format, only a few words have known meanings. The language can be confidently identified only as belonging to the Afroasiatic family, although it was likely part of the Berber languages, spoken at the start of the breakup of the Proto-Berber language, or possibly a sister branch to the modern Berber languages.[2][3][4].\nThought 6: Observation 5 states that Numidian was written in the Libyco-Berber alphabet and is considered to be part of the Berber languages, possibly a sister branch to modern Berber languages. Observation 3 confirmed that Ouargli (Teggargrent) and Tumzabt are closely related Zenati Berber languages. Therefore, Numidian, which was written with the Libyco-Berber script and is related to modern Berber languages, is the language that fits the description.\nAction 6: Finish[Numidian]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I should start by searching for \"ancient Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then look for languages related to it.\nAction 1: Search[ancient Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: Could not find ancient Libyco-Berber script. Similar: ['Libyco-Berber alphabet', 'Tifinagh (redirect from Berber script)', 'Berber languages', 'Proto-Sinaitic script', 'Zanata Stone'].\nThought 2: The previous search returned \"Libyco-Berber alphabet\" and \"Berber languages\". It's likely the script is related to Berber languages. I should search \"Berber languages\" to see if it mentions the ancient script and related languages like Tumzabt and Teggargrent.\nAction 2: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 2: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\nThought 3: The observation states that Berber languages were historically written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. It also mentions that Berber languages are closely related. However, it doesn't explicitly name a language that is written with this script AND is closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I need to find a specific Berber language that fits these criteria. I should search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to see if they are mentioned in relation to the Lib\nAction 3: yco-Berber script or other Berber languages.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: yco-Berber script or other Berber languages.\nThought 4: The previous observation mentioned \"Berber languages\" and I need to find a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I should search for Tumzabt and Teggargrent to see if they are identified as Berber languages, and if so, what their relationship is to other Berber languages and the Libyco-Berber script.\nAction 4: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 4: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 5: The observation states that Tumzabt (also known as Mozabite) is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites in Algeria. It's a Berber language. Now I need to do the same for Teggargrent and see if it's related to Tumzabt and if either is written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script.\nAction 5: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 5: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 6: The observation states that Teggargrent (Ouargli) is a Zenati Berber language and that speakers of Ouargla consider Tumzabt (Mozabite) as a dialect of a single language.

From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-\u0080\u00931846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: What language, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages?\nThought 1: I need to find the language that is traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script and is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages. I will start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to find their related languages.\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script. The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, which are also Berber languages. Therefore, I should search for information about Tumzabt and Teggargrent to see if they are related to Numidian or other ancient Berber languages. Since the question\nAction 2: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 2: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 3: Tumzabt is also known as Mozabite and is a Zenati language, part of the Mzab\u2013Wargla dialect cluster. The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, traditionally written with the Libyco-Berber script. I have found that Tumzabt is a Berber language. Now I need to find information about Teggargrent and its relation to Tumzabt and the Libyco-Berber script. I\nAction 3: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 3: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 4: The observation states that speakers from Ouargla (Teggargrent) regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine, and Tumzabt/Mozabite as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This implies that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related. The first observation mentioned that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian\nAction 4: Lookup[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The first observation mentioned that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The third observation states that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Zenati Berber languages and that speakers of Teggargrent consider them dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This means that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages. Since the Libyco-Berber script was used for ancient\nAction 5: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 5: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\nThought 6: The previous observations established that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages. The first observation stated that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The fifth observation confirms that Berber languages have historically been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. Therefore, the language that is traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script and is closely related to Tumzabt and T\nAction 6: Search[Numidian language]\nObservation 6: Numidian /n(j)u\u02d0\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259n/ was a language spoken in ancient Numidia. The script in which it was written, the Libyco-Berber alphabet (from which Tifinagh descended), has been almost fully deciphered and most characters (apart from a few exceptions restricted to specific areas) have known values. Libyco-Berber inscriptions are attested from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. As most surviving inscriptions are funerary steles with a simple format, only a few words have known meanings. The language can be confidently identified only as belonging to the Afroasiatic family, although it was likely part of the Berber languages, spoken at the start of the breakup of the Proto-Berber language, or possibly a sister branch to the modern Berber languages.[2][3][4].\nThought 7: The first observation stated that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The sixth observation confirms that Numidian language is part of the Afroasiatic family and was likely part of the Berber languages. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages, and the Libyco-Berber script was used for ancient Berber languages like Numidian, Numidian is the language being asked about.\nAction 7: Finish[Numidian]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",
