So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: What was Iqbal F. Qadir on when he participated in an attack on a radar station located on western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula?\nThought 1: I need to find information about an attack on a radar station on the western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula and identify Iqbal F. Qadir's role or what he was on during that attack. I will start by searching for \"Iqbal F. Qadir\".\nAction 1: Search[Iqbal F. Qadir]\nObservation 1: Iqbal Fazl Quadir (Urdu: \u0627\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631) HI(M), TI(M), SBt, TQA, (died 19 October 2020) was a three-star rank admiral in the Pakistan Navy, diplomat and a defence analyst. He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 2: The observation mentions Iqbal F. Qadir's participation in the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. It also mentions he was a Lieutenant in PNS Shamsher and later a Commander. The question asks what he was \"on\" when he participated in the attack. The observation states he was \"part of the flotilla\". A flotilla is a naval formation. Therefore, he was likely on a ship as part of the flotilla. I need to check if the observation\nAction 2: Lookup[flotilla]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 3) He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India..\nThought 3: The observation states he was part of the flotilla. A flotilla is a naval formation, implying he was on a ship. The question asks what he was \"on\". The most direct answer from the text is that he was part of the flotilla. I should look for information that specifies the vessel he was on.\nAction 3: Lookup[Dwarka]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 3) He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India..\nThought 4: The observation confirms he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka. It does not specify the ship he was on. I will search for more information about the attack on Dwarka radar station and the flotilla involved.\nAction 4: Search[Dwarka radar station attack]\nObservation 4: Could not find Dwarka radar station attack. Similar: ['Operation Dwarka', 'Integrated Coastal Surveillance System (redirect from Coastal Surveillance Radar System)', 'S. M. Anwar', 'Iqbal F. Qadir', 'Indira Gandhi International Airport (redirect from Palam Air Force Station)'].\nThought 5: The search for \"Dwarka radar station attack\" did not yield direct results but suggested \"Operation Dwarka\". This is likely the event in question. I will search for \"Operation Dwarka\".\nAction 5: Search[Operation Dwarka]\nObservation 5: Operation Dwarka was a naval operation by the Pakistan Navy to attack the Indian coastal town of Dwarka on 7 and 8 September 1965. This instance was the first engagement by the Pakistan Navy in any of the Indo-Pakistan wars.[a]. As the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 broke out between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, the armies and air forces of both nations were involved in intense fighting in the regions of Punjab and Kashmir. To relieve pressure on the southern front, Pakistan decided to send its navy to launch a strike on the Indian coast. The primary objective of the attack ostensibly was to destroy the radar station at Dwarka which was believed by Pakistani naval intelligence to have a Huff-Duff beacon to guide Indian bombers.[2] Pakistani high command also hoped to divert the operations of the Indian Air Force away from the north..\nThought 6: Operation Dwarka involved a Pakistan Navy flotilla attacking the radar station in Dwarka. The initial search for Iqbal F. Qadir mentioned he was part of this flotilla. The observation for \"Operation Dwarka\" doesn't specify which ship he was on, but it confirms the context. The question asks what he was \"on\". Since he was part of the Pakistan Navy's flotilla, he was on a Pakistan Navy ship. The text doesn't name the specific ship. However\nAction 6: Lookup[flotilla]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: The search results confirm that Iqbal F. Qadir was part of the Pakistan Navy flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka. The question asks what he was \"on\". While the specific ship is not mentioned, he was part of a naval operation, so he was on a Pakistan Navy ship. The observation from Action 1 stated he was a Lieutenant in PNS Shamsher and later a Commander. It's possible he was on PNS Shamsher during the attack, but this is not explicitly\nAction 7: Search[PNS Shamsher]\nObservation 7: Could not find PNS Shamsher. Similar: ['INS Tamal', 'HMS Diomede (F16) (redirect from PNS Shamsher (F263))', 'INS Udaygiri (2022)', 'Project 17B-class frigate', 'Pakistan Navy'].\n",

The Adam Friedland Show was preceded by Cum Town, a comedy podcast hosted by Mullen, Friedland, and fellow comedian Stavros Halkias.[1][2] On June 25, 2022, Halkias announced that he was no longer part of Cum Town.[3] Subsequently, Mullen and Friedland revealed their plan for a spin-off production\u2014The Adam Friedland Show\u2014to be hosted by Friedland and produced by Mullen.. During the summer of 2022, test episodes of The Adam Friedland Show were released while the show's set was being constructed. These episodes began as audio-only conversations between Mullen, Friedland, and an occasional guest. The first episode to feature a video recording was shot in the creators' unfurnished studio and released in August 2022.[4] Audio-only podcasts continued to be released to the public, with the full video-based episodes available only to Patreon supporters..\nThought 4: The Adam Friedland Show is a web-based talk show.

Born in London and raised largely in the Cheshire village of Alderley Edge, Healy formed the 1975 in 2002 with his schoolmates at Wilmslow High School. After signing with independent record label Dirty Hit, the band released four extended plays before releasing their self-titled studio album in 2013. They followed it with I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016), A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018), Notes on a Conditional Form (2020) and Being Funny in a Foreign Language (2022).\nThought 6: Matty Healy formed the band The 1975 with his schoolmates at Wilmslow High School.

As of June 2025, the school has a pupil intake of 2,196 pupils, despite only having a school capacity of 1,977 pupils.[4]. Wilmslow High School was originally established as the co-educational Wilmslow County Grammar School in September 1960 with 900 pupils.[5] The new county grammar school was opened by Sir James Mountford, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, on 24 March 1961. A girls' grammar school was built on 14 acres (57,000\u00a0m2) of the former Colshaw Hall Farm, and situated on Dean Row Road. It opened in 1964 and housed 750 girls.\nThought 7: The observation states that Wilmslow High School was originally established as the co-educational Wilmslow County Grammar School. The question asks for the designation of the school. \"Comprehensive secondary school\" is a designation, and \"grammar school\" is also a designation.

Similar: ['Danny DeVito', 'Rhea Perlman', 'The Lorax (film) (category 2012 computer-animated films)', 'Batman Returns (category Films scored by Danny Elfman)', 'Robert Costanzo'].\nThought 2: The initial search did not yield a direct list of animated movies starring Danny DeVito. I should search for Danny DeVito and look for movies he starred in, then filter for animated ones.\nAction 2: Search[Danny DeVito]\nObservation 2: Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. (born November 17, 1944) is an American actor and filmmaker. He gained prominence for his portrayal of the taxi dispatcher Louie De Palma in the television series Taxi (1978\u20131983), which won him a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award.

I will search for this movie to see if Danny DeVito starred in it and if Kool Kojak was involved in its music.\nAction 4: Search[Hercules (1997 film)]\nObservation 4: Hercules is a 1997 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the legendary hero Heracles (known in the film by his Roman name, Hercules), a son of Zeus in Greek mythology. The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, both of whom also produced the film with Alice Dewey Goldstone. The screenplay was written by Clements, Musker, Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw, and Irene Mecchi. Featuring the voices of Tate Donovan, Danny DeVito, James Woods, and Susan Egan, the film follows the titular Hercules, a demigod with super-strength raised among mortals, who must learn to become a true hero in order to earn back his godhood and place in Mount Olympus, while his evil uncle Hades plots his downfall..\nThought 5: Hercules (1997 film) stars Danny DeVito.

He and other UniSols serve as remote-controlled superhuman soldiers sent into the most dangerous situations..\nThought 3: The actors who have played Luc Deveraux are Jean-Claude Van Damme and Matt Battaglia.

So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist.

I need to find information about conflicts between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape, identify specific attacks, and determine which one had the highest casualties. Then I need to identify the captain responsible for that attack.\n\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape conflict]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape conflict. Similar: ['Lenape', 'New Netherland', 'Conquest of New Sweden', 'Kechemeche (category People from New Netherland)', 'Pavonia, New Netherland'].\nThought 2: The search term \"New Netherland Lenape conflict\" was not found. I need to try searching for related terms. The similar results suggest I should look into \"Lenape\" and \"New Netherland\" separately, or perhaps specific incidents like \"Pavonia, New Netherland\". Given the mention of \"casualties\" and \"attack\", I should focus on specific conflicts. I will try searching for \"Pavonia massacre\" as it is a known conflict between settlers and the Lenape.\nAction 2: Search[Pavonia massacre]\nObservation 2: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 3: The \"Pavonia massacre\" is mentioned as a conflict, but the observation does not describe any specific attack or casualties, nor does it mention a captain. I need to find more information about this event or other conflicts. I will look for more details about the Pavonia massacre, specifically looking for information about an attack and casualties.\nAction 3: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 7) Kieft decided, against the advice of the council of Twelve Men, to punish the native population who had taken refuge among the Netherlanders (their presumed allies), when fleeing raiding Mahican from the north, by attacking Pavonia and Corlear's Hook.[6] The initial strike which he ordered on February 25, 1643, and took place at Communipaw, was a massacre: 129 Dutch soldiers killed 120 Native Americans, including women and children.\nThought 4: The observation states that Kieft ordered an attack on Pavonia and Corlear's Hook. This attack resulted in the death of 120 Native Americans, including women and children. This seems to be the incident with the most casualties mentioned so far. Kieft is identified as the person who ordered the attack. I need to confirm if Kieft was a captain and if this attack led to more casualties than any other incident in the war. The question asks for the Captain who launched the attack\nAction 4: Search[Kieft]\nObservation 4: Kieft is a Dutch surname.

HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages.\nThought 5: The search for \"Kieft\" did not provide enough information about his role or if he was a captain. The previous observation mentioned \"Kieft decided\" and \"he ordered\", implying he was in a leadership position. I need to find out if Kieft was a captain and if this attack had the highest casualties. I will try to look up \"Kieft\" again but specifically for his role in New Netherland.\nAction 5: Lookup[Kieft New Netherland]\nObservation\nObservation 5: Invalid action: lookup[Kieft New Netherland]\nObservation\nThought 6: The previous action 'lookup[Kieft New Netherland]' was invalid. I need to search for \"Kieft\" to understand his role in New Netherland, as the previous observation suggested he ordered an attack.\nAction 6: Search[Kieft]\nObservation 6: Kieft is a Dutch surname.

The previous observation stated \"Kieft decided\" and \"he ordered\", suggesting a leadership position but not specifying \"captain\". I need to find out if Kieft was a captain and if this attack resulted in the most casualties. Given the previous search for \"Kieft\" was unhelpful, I will try searching for \"Peter Stuyvesant\" as he was a prominent figure in New Netherland,\nAction 7: Search[Peter Stuyvesant]\nObservation 7: Peter Stuyvesant[note 1] (c.\u20091610 \u2013 August 1672)[1][2] was a Dutch colonial administrator who served as the director-general of New Netherland from 1647 to 1664, when the colony was provisionally ceded to the Kingdom of England.[3] He was a major figure in the history of New York City and his name has been given to various landmarks and points of interest throughout the city (e.g. Stuyvesant High School, Stuyvesant Town, Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood, etc.).. Stuyvesant's accomplishments as director-general of New Netherland included a great expansion for the settlement of New Amsterdam beyond the southern tip of Manhattan. Among the projects built by Stuyvesant's administration were the protective wall on Wall Street, the canal that became Broad Street, and Broadway. Stuyvesant, himself a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, opposed religious pluralism and came into conflict with Lutherans, Jews, Roman Catholics, and Quakers as they attempted to build places of worship in the city and practice their faiths..\n",

I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to find information about attacks and casualties.\nAction 2: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 2: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 3: The observation for Kieft's War states that \"Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants\". It also mentions that the war is named after Director-General Willem Kieft, who ordered an attack. The question asks which Captain launched the attack with the most casualties.

While he ordered it, the observation doesn't explicitly state he *launched* it, nor does it mention casualties for specific attacks.

I will start by searching for conflicts between New Netherland and the Lenape.\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape conflict]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape conflict. Similar: ['Lenape', 'New Netherland', 'Kechemeche (category People from New Netherland)', 'Conquest of New Sweden', 'Pavonia, New Netherland'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape conflict\" did not yield direct results. I should try searching for a more specific event or a broader term that might encompass such conflicts. Let's try searching for \"Pavonia Massacre\", as that is a known conflict between the Dutch settlers and the Lenape.\nAction 2: Search[Pavonia Massacre]\nObservation 2: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 3: The current observation discusses the initial settlement of Pavonia and its early interactions with the Lenape. It does not mention the specific attack that led to the most casualties or the captain responsible. I need to look for information within this passage or related passages about a significant attack and its leader. I will try to find mentions of attacks or massacres related to Pavonia and the Lenape.\nAction 3: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 7) Kieft decided, against the advice of the council of Twelve Men, to punish the native population who had taken refuge among the Netherlanders (their presumed allies), when fleeing raiding Mahican from the north, by attacking Pavonia and Corlear's Hook.[6] The initial strike which he ordered on February 25, 1643, and took place at Communipaw, was a massacre: 129 Dutch soldiers killed 120 Native Americans, including women and children.\nThought 4: The observation mentions that Kieft ordered an attack on Pavonia and Corlear's Hook. This attack resulted in the death of 120 Native Americans, including women and children. The question asks about the captain who launched the attack that led to the most casualties. This observation states Kieft ordered the initial strike. It is likely that Kieft is the captain in question. I need to confirm if this was the incident with the most casualties and if Kieft is considered a captain.\nAction 4: Lookup[Kieft]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 9) These conflicts led to rising tensions and eventually an incident that started a series of raids and reprisals, known as Kieft's War.[12].\nThought 5: The observation mentions \"Kieft's War\" and that Kieft ordered the attack at Pavonia. The question asks for the captain who launched the attack with the most casualties. The previous observation stated that Kieft ordered the strike which resulted in 120 Native American deaths. This is a significant number of casualties. I need to find out if Kieft was indeed a captain and if this was the incident with the most casualties in the war between the settlers of New Netherland and the Len\nAction 5: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 5: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 6: The observation states that Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland and ordered an attack on Lenape camps which resulted in massacres. The question asks for the captain who launched the attack with the most casualties. While \"Director-General\" is not explicitly \"Captain,\" it is a leadership role. The observation also mentions that the attack resulted in massacres and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides, suggesting significant casualties. I need to confirm if this was the incident with the most casualties\nAction 6: Lookup[casualties]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: The previous search for \"Pavonia Massacre\" mentioned that Kieft ordered an attack on February 25, 1643, which resulted in 120 Native American deaths. The search for \"Kieft's War\" confirmed that Willem Kieft, as Director-General, ordered attacks that led to massacres. The question asks for the captain who launched the attack with the most casualties. While the term \"captain\" isn't explicitly used for Kieft, his role\nAction 7: as Director-General implies leadership in military actions. Given that the Pavonia Massacre resulted in 120 deaths and precipitated further conflict, it's a strong candidate for the incident with the most casualties. The question asks \"Which Captain launched the attack...\". Since Kieft ordered the attack, and it's the most significant event described, I will assume \"captain\" refers to the leader who ordered the attack.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: as Director-General implies leadership in military actions. Given that the Pavonia Massacre resulted in 120 deaths and precipitated further conflict, it's a strong candidate for the incident with the most casualties. The question asks \"Which Captain launched the attack...\". Since Kieft ordered the attack, and it's the most significant event described, I will assume \"captain\" refers to the leader who ordered the attack.\n",

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The search for \"Nightmares\" did not provide a release year for a film.

Its plot follows a deranged man who, after undergoing an experimental medical procedure, is released from a New York City psychiatric hospital and embarks on a road trip to Florida with the intent of murdering his ex-wife and child.. Scavolini, an Italian director who had previously worked making experimental films, developed the idea for Nightmare after reading newspaper articles about psychiatric patients who had been administered powerful drugs that altered their behavior. He completed the film's screenplay over a two-week period while vacationing in Cocoa Beach, Florida, where he chose to set the majority of the film. The film was shot on location in Florida and New York City in late 1980..\nThought 4: The film \"Nightmare\" was released in 1981.

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The search for \"Nightmares\" did not yield a film title, but rather a definition of the word.

I should search for \"Xyloband\" to see if it provides any information about the origin of the idea and the associated instrument.\nAction 2: Search[Xyloband]\nObservation 2: A Xyloband is a wristband that contains light-emitting diodes and a radio frequency receiver. Used primarily in the live entertainment industry, it was launched by RB Concepts Ltd, a company set up by entrepreneur Clive Banks with inventor Jason Regler. The lights inside the wristband can be controlled by a software program, which sends signals to the wristband, instructing it to light up or blink, for example. The single colour version is available in green, blue, yellow, red, pink, and white.. The first use of Xylobands on a large scale was on British rock band Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto Tour.\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Xyloband\" mentioned Jason Regler as an inventor. The question asks about an idea for flashing wristbands during a song built around an instrument. The observation mentions that Xylobands were used on Coldplay's \"Mylo Xyloto Tour\". I should look for information about this tour and any specific songs or instruments associated with the wristbands.

The concert run featured 76 shows across four continents, starting at Glasgow's SEC Centre on 3 December 2011 and ending at New York City's Barclays Center on 31 December 2012.[3] A visit to Latin America was originally set for 2013, later being cancelled.. Prior to the tour, the band embarked on a series of promotional and festival performances, including Austin City Limits,[4] Glastonbury,[5] Lollapalooza,[6] and Rock in Rio.[7] Coldplay held concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well.[8] They became the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows,[9] popularising them in the live music industry.[10] According to Pollstar, the tour grossed over $181.3 million from 2.1 million tickets sold across 75 reported dates.[11]. After devoting the summer of 2011 to a promotional tour in Europe, the Americas and Africa,[12] the band announced the tour via their Twitter account in September 2011.\nThought 4: The observation states that Xylobands were used on Coldplay's \"Mylo Xyloto Tour\" and that they were the first musicians to use LED wristbands.

This suggests that the information might not be readily available in that specific phrasing or that the connection to a particular instrument is not explicitly stated in public records.
