He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 3: The previous search mentioned that Iqbal F. Qadir was part of a flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. It also states he was trained in signals and served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant. The question asks what he was \"on\" during the attack. Being part of a flotilla implies he was on a ship.

The question asks what he was \"on\". Being part of a flotilla means he was on a ship within that flotilla. The observation doesn't explicitly name the ship. I need to find out which ship he was on. I will search for \"Dwarka attack flotilla\" or \"Pakistan Navy ships Dwarka attack\".\nAction 5: Search[Dwarka attack flotilla]\nObservation 5: Could not find Dwarka attack flotilla. Similar: ['Iqbal F.

The similar results suggest looking into naval battles and the history of the Indian Navy. Since the previous observation mentioned he was part of a flotilla led by Cdre. (Commodore), I should try to find information about that specific flotilla or the ships involved in the Dwarka attack. I will try searching for \"Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka attack\".\nAction 6: Search[Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka\nObservation 6: Invalid action: search[Pakistan Navy flotilla Dwarka\nThought 7: The search term was too long and contained a space.

Qadir during this attack.\nAction 1: Search[attack on radar station Okhamandal Peninsula]\nObservation 1: Could not find attack on radar station Okhamandal Peninsula. Similar: ['Indian Rebellion of 1857 (category Commons category link is on Wikidata)'].\nThought 2: The search did not yield direct results. I will try searching for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" to get general information about the location and then look for any significant events or attacks that might have occurred there.\nAction 2: Search[Okhamandal Peninsula]\nObservation 2: Could not find Okhamandal Peninsula. Similar: ['Dwarka', 'Bet Dwarka', 'List of railway companies in India', 'Prant', 'Kingdom of Valabhi'].\nThought 3: The search for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" did not yield direct results.

Similar: ['Dwarka', 'Vadhel', 'Dwarkadhish Temple', 'Indian Rebellion of 1857', 'List of districts of Gujarat'].\nThought 4: The searches for \"Okhamandal Peninsula\" and \"Okhamandal\" did not provide relevant information about an attack or Iqbal F. Qadir. It is possible the premise of the question is incorrect, or the information is not available through these searches. I will try searching for \"Iqbal F. Qadir\" to see if I can find any information about involvement in any attacks, which might indirectly lead to the radar station.\nAction 4: Search[Iqbal F.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: search[Iqbal F.\nThought 5: Qadir]\nAction 5: Search[Iqbal F.

He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.. Having joined the Pakistan Navy in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals in Britannia Royal Naval College in England before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the PNS Shamsher as Lieutenant.:\u200a100\u200a[1]. In 1965, Commander Iqbal F. Quadir was among the commanding officers who were chosen to be a part of the  flotilla led by Cdre.\nThought 6: The observation mentions that Iqbal F. Quadir was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India. Dwarka is likely the same location as Okhamandal Peninsula. The question asks what he was \"on\" when he participated in the attack. The observation states he was part of the \"flotilla\". I should confirm if \"flotilla\" is a type of vessel or a larger unit. The observation also states he was a \"three-star rank admiral\nAction 6: Lookup[flotilla]\nObservation 6: (Result 1 / 3) He was renowned for his participation in Pakistan's\u00a0second war with India when he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India..\nThought 7: The observation states that he was part of the \"flotilla\". While a flotilla is a small fleet of warships, the question asks what he was \"on\", implying a specific vessel. The text doesn't specify the type of vessel he was on within the flotilla. It mentions he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in signals. It also mentions he served as Lieutenant in PNS Shamsher. However, it doesn't explicitly state he was *on* PNS Shamsher during\nAction 7: the attack on Dwarka. I need to check if any other information can be extracted about his role or the vessel he was on.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the attack on Dwarka. I need to check if any other information can be extracted about his role or the vessel he was on.\n",

As of June 2025, the school has a pupil intake of 2,196 pupils, despite only having a school capacity of 1,977 pupils.[4]. Wilmslow High School was originally established as the co-educational Wilmslow County Grammar School in September 1960 with 900 pupils.[5] The new county grammar school was opened by Sir James Mountford, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, on 24 March 1961. A girls' grammar school was built on 14 acres (57,000\u00a0m2) of the former Colshaw Hall Farm, and situated on Dean Row Road. It opened in 1964 and housed 750 girls.\nThought 7: The observation mentions that Wilmslow High School was originally established as Wilmslow County Grammar School. The question asks for the designation of the school where the Wilmslow Show is held. While the observation doesn't explicitly state that the Wilmslow Show is held at Wilmslow High School, it's a strong possibility given the name and the previous searches. The original designation was \"Wilmslow County Grammar School\". I will assume this is the answer.\nAction 7: Finish[Wilmslow County Grammar School]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

Similar: [\"Matty Healy (redirect from Matty Healy's appearance on The Adam Friedland Show)\", 'Sarah Hadland', 'The 1975', 'George Daniel', 'Alderley Edge'].\nThought 2: The search result did not directly identify the school where the Wilmslow Show is held. It provided similar entities, one of which is \"Alderley Edge\". It's possible the Wilmslow Show is related to Alderley Edge, and I should investigate that.\nAction 2: Search[Alderley Edge]\nObservation 2: Alderley Edge is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England, 6 miles (10\u00a0km) north-west of Macclesfield and 12 miles (19\u00a0km) south of Manchester. It lies at the base of a wooded sandstone escarpment, The Edge, overlooking the Cheshire Plain. As of the 2021 census, its population was 4,777.. The village is known for its affluence, expensive homes and location within Cheshire's Golden Triangle.[2][3] Its cafes and designer shops attract Premier League footballers, actors and businesspeople,[4] making it one of the UK's most sought-after places to live outside London.[3]. The Alderley Edge area shows signs of occupation since the Mesolithic period, with flint tools found along its sandstone outcrop.\nThought 3: The observation for Alderley Edge does not mention the Wilmslow Show or any school associated with it. I need to go back to the search results for \"Wilmslow Show\" and consider other similar entities or try a different approach. Since the previous searches did not yield the answer, I will try searching for \"Wilmslow\" directly to see if it provides any context related to events or schools.\nAction 3: Search[Wilmslow]\nObservation 3: Wilmslow (/\u02c8w\u026almslo\u028a/ or /\u02c8w\u026amslo\u028a/) is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. It is 11 miles (18\u00a0km) south of Manchester. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 26,213 and the built up area had a population of 25,725.. Wilmslow derives its name from Old English W\u012bghelmes hl\u0101w, meaning \"mound of a man called W\u012bghelm.\"[4]. Much about the local Iron Age history of Wilmslow was uncovered with the discovery of Lindow Man, in Lindow Moss.\nThought 4: The observation for Wilmslow mentions its location and history but not the Wilmslow Show or any associated school. It seems the initial search and subsequent related searches did not provide the necessary information. Given the lack of progress, it's unlikely I can find the answer with further Wikipedia searches. I will indicate that the information is not available.\nAction 4: Finish[null]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

He started his relationship with the Royal Court Theatre under Stephen Daldry in 1995.

Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz stated that the Universal Soldier franchise \"is a rare series that takes more creative risks as it goes along\".[3]. Directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Richard Rothstein, Christopher Leitch, and Dean Devlin, it stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and Ally Walker.. In the first installment of the franchise, American soldier Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) finds that his superior officer, Andrew Scott (Lundgren), has turned violently deranged, and the two fight to the death during the Vietnam War.\nThought 3: The actors who played Luc Deveraux are Jean-Claude Van Damme and Matt Battaglia. Scott Adkins played a new protagonist named John in a later film, so he is not relevant to Luc Deveraux.

Born and raised in Brussels, his father enrolled him in a Shotokan karate school at the age of ten, which led Van Damme to hold the rank of 2nd-dan black belt in karate, and compete in several karate and kickboxing competitions. As a teenager, he won the middleweight championship of the European Professional Karate Association in 1979 and the Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in 1978.

It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom subsequently left the show.\nThought 7: \"Holby City\" is a British medical drama and does not mention Jean-Claude Van Damme. This suggests he did not star in it. I need to check the other movies for him. Since the previous searches for his filmography were not successful, I will try to search for \"Doctor Strange\" and see if Jean-Claude Van Damme is mentioned.

I need to find information about this war and identify the specific incident with the highest casualties and the captain responsible. I will start by searching for \"New Netherland Lenape war\".\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape war]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape war. Similar: ['Lenape', \"Kieft's War\", 'New Netherland', 'Pavonia, New Netherland', 'New York (state)'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape war\" did not yield direct results. However, the similar entities suggest \"Kieft's War\" might be relevant, which was a conflict between the Lenape and Dutch settlers in New Netherland. I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to gather information about it.\nAction 2: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 2: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 3: Kieft's War involved attacks on Lenape camps and massacres. The question asks about the attack that led to more casualties than any other incident. The observation states that Willem Kieft had ordered an attack without approval, and that Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred inhabitants. It also mentions that this precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. I need to determine if any specific attack is mentioned as having the highest casualties. The observation doesn't explicitly state which incident had the most casualties\nAction 3: Lookup[massacred]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 2) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 4: The observation mentions that Willem Kieft ordered an attack and that Dutch colonists massacred inhabitants. This implies Willem Kieft is the leader who ordered the attack. The question asks \"Which Captain launched the attack\". Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, which can be considered a leadership role akin to a captain in this context. The text states \"Willem Kieft... had ordered an attack\". This directly links him to launching the attack. I need to confirm if this attack\nAction 4: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 7) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 5: The observation states that Willem Kieft ordered an attack. The question asks which Captain launched the attack. Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, a leadership position. The text explicitly says he \"ordered an attack\". While it doesn't explicitly state this attack caused more casualties than any other, it describes massacres and waves of attacks on both sides, implying significant casualties. Given the information, Willem Kieft is the most likely answer as the person who initiated the conflict described.\nAction 5: Finish[Willem Kieft]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I will start by searching for information on conflicts between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population.\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape conflict]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape conflict. Similar: ['Lenape', 'New Netherland', 'Conquest of New Sweden', 'Kechemeche (category People from New Netherland)', 'Pavonia, New Netherland'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape conflict\" did not yield direct results. I need to find information about wars or conflicts between the settlers of New Netherland and the Lenape population. I will try searching for a more general term related to conflicts in New Netherland.\nAction 2: Search[New Netherland conflict]\nObservation 2: Could not find New Netherland conflict. Similar: ['Conquest of New Netherland', 'New Netherland', 'Pavonia, New Netherland', 'Netherlands (redirect from The netherland)', 'New Amsterdam'].\nThought 3: The search results are not directly answering the question about the specific incident with the most casualties. I need to look for a specific event that involved both New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population and resulted in significant casualties. The term \"Pavonia massacre\" might be relevant, as it refers to an incident where Dutch colonists attacked a Lenape settlement. I will search for this term.\nAction 3: Search[Pavonia massacre]\nObservation 3: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 4: The observation for \"Pavonia massacre\" does not mention the massacre itself or any details about it, only the history of Pavonia. I need to find information about the Pavonia massacre and who led the attack. I will try searching for \"Pavonia massacre casualties\" or \"attack on Pavonia\".\nAction 4: Search[Pavonia massacre attack]\nObservation 4: Could not find Pavonia massacre attack. Similar: ['Pavonia, New Netherland', 'Massacre at Corlears Hook', 'Pound Ridge massacre', \"Kieft's War (category Massacres of Native Americans)\", 'List of Indian massacres in North America'].\nThought 5: The previous search did not directly yield information about the attack or casualties. The similar results suggest \"Kieft's War\" might be relevant, as it often involved massacres. I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to see if it provides details about specific incidents and leaders.\nAction 5: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 5: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.

Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 6: Kieft's War involved attacks on Lenape camps and massacres. The war was initiated by Willem Kieft. The question asks which Captain launched the attack that led to more casualties. Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland, which is a position of leadership equivalent to captain in this context, and he ordered the attack. I need to confirm if this war had the most casualties. However, the text states \"Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants,\nAction 6: Lookup[most casualties]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: The text mentions that Kieft's War involved massacres and attacks on both sides. However, it does not explicitly state that it resulted in more casualties than any other incident in the war between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape population. Without further information to confirm this, I cannot definitively answer the question. The question asks for the captain who launched the attack with *more* casualties than *any other incident*.

I will try searching for \"Pavonia Massacre\" as this is a known historical event involving the Lenape and New Netherland settlers that resulted in significant casualties.\nAction 5: Search[Pavonia Massacre]\nObservation 5: Pavonia was the first European settlement on the west bank of the North River (Hudson River) that was part of the seventeenth-century province of New Netherland in what would become the present Hudson County, New Jersey.[1]. The first European to record exploration of the area was Robert Juet, first mate of Henry Hudson, an English sea captain commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. Their ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), ventured in the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay and anchored at Weehawken Cove during 1609, while exploring the Upper New York Bay and the Hudson Valley.[2] By 1617 a factorij, or trading post, was established at Communipaw.[3][4]. Initially, these posts were set up for fur trade with the indigenous population. At that time the area was inhabited by bands of Algonquian language speaking peoples, known collectively as Lenni Lenape and later called the Delawares.\nThought 6: The observation for Pavonia Massacre mentions European settlement and fur trade with the Lenape, but not the specific incident of the massacre or the captain responsible. It also does not mention casualties. I need to find information about the massacre itself and who launched it. I will look up \"Pavonia Massacre\" again to find more details, specifically about the attack and its leader.\nAction 6: Lookup[Pavonia Massacre]\nObservation 6: (Result 1 / 2) Historians differ on whether or not the massacre was Kieft's idea.[15][16] This is sometimes referred to as the Pavonia Massacre.[17] The same night also saw a similar if smaller attack in Manhattan, the Massacre at Corlears Hook.\nThought 7: The observation mentions \"Kieft's idea\" and \"Massacre at Corlears Hook\" as a similar attack. This suggests that Kieft might be the person responsible for the attack. I need to confirm if Kieft launched the attack and if it resulted in high casualties. I will search for \"Kieft\" in the context of the Pavonia Massacre.\nAction 7: Lookup[Kieft]\nObservation 7: (Result 1 / 9) These conflicts led to rising tensions and eventually an incident that started a series of raids and reprisals, known as Kieft's War.[12].\n",

First, I need to find out when \"Nightmares\" was released.\nAction 1: Search[Nightmares]\nObservation 1: A nightmare, also known as a bad dream,[1] is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically fear but also despair, anxiety, disgust or sadness. The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The previous search for \"Nightmares\" did not yield any information about a film with that title. I should try searching for \"Nightmare\" as a film title. It's possible the question meant \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" or a similar film.

It seems the term \"Nightmares\" might be too general or there isn't a prominent film solely titled \"Nightmares.\" I should try searching for films with \"Nightmare\" in their title that Emilio Estevez might have been in. Since the previous searches were not fruitful, I will try searching for Emilio Estevez's filmography to see if I can find a\nAction 3: Search[Emilio Estevez filmography]\nObservation 3: Could not find Emilio Estevez filmography.

However, it suggested related individuals. I will search for \"Emilio Estevez\" to get general information about his career, which might include film titles.\nAction 4: Search[Emilio Estevez]\nObservation 4: Emilio Estevez (/\u025b\u02c8m\u026alio\u028a \u025b\u02c8st\u0259v\u025bs/; born May 12, 1962) is an American actor and filmmaker. The son of actor Martin Sheen and the older brother of Charlie Sheen, he  made his film debut with an uncredited role in Badlands (1973). He later received his first credited appearance with a supporting role in the coming-of-age film Tex (1982).. Estevez gained mainstream recognition with a starring role in the drama film The Outsiders (1983), leading him to be associated with a group of young actors known as the \"Brat Pack.\" After starring in the films Nightmares (1983) and Repo Man (1984), Estevez had his breakout with starring roles in the commercially successful Brat Pack films The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985).\nThought 5: The observation states that Emilio Estevez starred in \"Nightmares (1983)\". The question asks for a film he starred in the same year as \"Nightmares\". Since he starred *in* \"Nightmares\" in 1983, I need to find another film he starred in that same year.

Prior to the tour, the band embarked on a series of promotional and festival performances, including Austin City Limits,[4] Glastonbury,[5] Lollapalooza,[6] and Rock in Rio.[7] Coldplay held concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well.[8] They became the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows,[9] popularising them in the live music industry.[10] According to Pollstar, the tour grossed over $181.3 million from 2.1 million tickets sold across 75 reported dates.[11]. After devoting the summer of 2011 to a promotional tour in Europe, the Americas and Africa,[12] the band announced the tour via their Twitter account in September 2011.\nThought 4: The observation for Mylo Xyloto Tour mentions that Coldplay were the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows, popularizing them.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician.

I will start by searching \"Blackzilians\".\nAction 1: Search[Blackzilians]\nObservation 1: The Blackzilians was a professional team of fighters in mixed martial arts, boxing, kickboxing, amateur wrestling and catch wrestling located in South Florida. The team had included former UFC champions Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, Eddie Alvarez and Kamaru Usman.. Owned by Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians, started when MMA fighters Jorge Santiago, Danillo Villefort, Yuri Villefort, and Gesias Cavalcante left American Top Team.[1] The name 'Blackzilians' was coined when Strikeforce Middleweight Danillo Villefort was looking through their management's website and pointed out to Robinson that every fighter (at the time) was Black or Brazilian.[2]. It was reported on September 20, 2018, that Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians founder, had died of a suspected heart attack.[3]. As of 2017, the Blackzilians as a gym is considered defunct.[4][5] Many of its members have left to join Combat Club, now Kill Cliff Fight Club (founded by Blackzilians trainers Henri Hooft and Greg Jones) which is considered a successor to the Blackzilians.[5].\nThought 2: The previous search for \"Blackzilians\" mentions former UFC champions Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, Eddie Alvarez and Kamaru Usman. It also mentions that the gym is defunct as of 2017. I need to find out which of these fighters (or any other fighter associated with Blackzilians) is currently competing in the Middleweight division of UFC. I will start by searching for Kamaru Usman.\nAction 2: Search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 2\nObservation 2: Invalid action: search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 2\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Blackzilians\" mentioned Kamaru Usman as a former UFC champion. I need to find out if he is currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. I will search for Kamaru Usman.\nAction 3: Search[Kamaru Usman]\nObservation 3: Kamarudeen Usman[1] (born May 11, 1987) is a Nigerian-American[9] professional mixed martial artist, former freestyle wrestler, and graduated folkstyle wrestler. He currently competes in the Welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former UFC Welterweight Champion. Usman is also The Ultimate Fighter 21 tournament winner. He is considered one of the greatest Welterweights of all time.[10][11][12][13] As of May 13, 2025, he is #5 in the UFC welterweight rankings.[14]. As a freestyle wrestler, Usman primarily competed at 84 kilograms (185\u00a0lb), and was a 2010 U.S.\nThought 4: Kamaru Usman currently competes in the Welterweight division, not the Middleweight division. I need to check the other fighters mentioned in the \"Blackzilians\" description to see if any of them are currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. The fighters mentioned are Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, and Eddie Alvarez. I will start by searching for Vitor Belfort.\nAction 4: Search[Vitor Belfort]\nObservation 4: V\u00edtor Vieira Belfort[4] (Portuguese pronunciation: [\u02c8vito\u0281 vi\u02c8ej\u027e\u0250 b\u025bw\u02c8f\u0254\u0281]; born 1 April 1977) is a Brazilian professional boxer and retired mixed martial artist who competed for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he fought in the Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, and Middleweight divisions. He is the UFC 12 Heavyweight Tournament Champion, as well as a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and Cage Rage World Light Heavyweight Champion. Known for his explosive knockout power, Belfort is tied for fifth for the most finishes in UFC history with 14.[5] Belfort also competed for MMA promotions Pride FC, Strikeforce, and Affliction.. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Belfort began training in boxing at the age of 12 under Claudio Coelho. Belfort later studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Carlson Gracie, who gave him his black belt.\nThought 5: Vitor Belfort competed in the Middleweight division of the UFC. The question asks which \"Blackzilians\" fighter is *currently* competing in the Middleweight division. Vitor Belfort is retired, so he is not currently competing. I need to check the remaining fighters: Rashad Evans and Eddie Alvarez. I will search for Rashad Evans.\nAction 5: Search[Rashad Evans]\nObservation 5: Rashad Evans (born September 25, 1979) is an American retired mixed martial artist who competed in the Light Heavyweight division. Evans started his professional MMA career in 2003, and was the Heavyweight winner of The Ultimate Fighter 2 in 2005. In 2008, Evans won the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, and in 2019, was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.. In present day, he serves on the UFC broadcasting team as a desk analyst[5] while also advocating for the health benefits of functional mushrooms through his company Umbo, co-founded alongside former NFL quarterback, Jake Plummer.[6]. Wrestling out of Niagara-Wheatfield High School in Sanborn, New York, Evans twice made it to the state finals tournament of New York by winning his weight class for his region, in which he received All-State honors both times.\nThought 6: Rashad Evans is retired and competes in the Welterweight division. I need to check Eddie Alvarez.\nAction 6: Search[Eddie Alvarez]\nObservation 6: Edward Alvarez[3] (born January 11, 1984) is an American professional mixed martial artist and bare-knuckle boxer who most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC.[4] He formerly competed in the Lightweight divisions of the UFC and Bellator MMA, where he was the UFC Lightweight Champion, and the inaugural and two-time Bellator Lightweight Champion. He also competed for the Japanese DREAM promotion, where he fought in their inaugural Lightweight Grand Prix, along with fighting in ONE FC, where he competed in their 2019 Lightweight World Grand Prix. Alvarez has also competed in EliteXC.. Alvarez is the first fighter to have won championships in both Bellator MMA and the UFC. He holds notable wins over former world champions Pat Curran, Michael Chandler, Shinya Aoki, Gilbert Melendez, Justin Gaethje, Anthony Pettis, Eduard Folayang, Patricky Freire and Rafael dos Anjos.\nThought 7: Eddie Alvarez competed in the Lightweight divisions of the UFC and Bellator MMA, and most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC. He is not currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. Since all the fighters mentioned in the initial search are either retired or not competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC, it's possible there isn't a \"Blackzilians\" fighter that fits the criteria. However, the initial search also stated that \"Many of its members have\nAction 7: Search[Blackzilians members Middleweight UFC]\nObservation 7: Could not find Blackzilians members Middleweight UFC.

This article about a location in the Mexican state of Sinaloa is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Villa Uni\u00f3n is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, but it doesn't state that the state was named after the town, or vice versa. I need to find out which Mexican state is referenced in the naming of Villa Uni\u00f3n. I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" and look for information about its naming origin.\nAction 2: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n]\nObservation 2: Villa Uni\u00f3n is a city in northwestern Argentina and the main settlement of Coronel Felipe Varela Department with a population of 12,263.. The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" yielded information about a city in Argentina, not the Mexican state. The original question is about a Mexican state. I need to re-focus my search on the \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" context and investigate the naming origin related to a Mexican state.

It is divided into 18 municipalities, and its capital city is Culiac\u00e1n Rosales.. It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast. To the west, Sinaloa faces Baja California Sur, across the Gulf of California.

I need to find out if there is a Mexican state named \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" or if \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" is named after a Mexican state.

The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 4: The current observation is about Villa Uni\u00f3n in Argentina, not Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa in Mexico.

In the hierarchy of Mexican administrative divisions, states are further divided into municipalities. Currently there are 2,462 municipalities in Mexico.. Although not formally a state, political reforms have enabled Mexico City (Spanish: Ciudad de M\u00e9xico), the capital city of the United Mexican States to have a federative entity status equivalent to that of the states since January 29, 2016..\nThought 6: The current observation lists the administrative divisions of Mexico but does not provide any information about a Mexican state named \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" or a state after which \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" is named.

I should start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then look for languages related to it, specifically those that are also related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent.\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, specifically mentioning Numidian language. The question asks for a language written with this script and related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages. Therefore, the language I am looking for is likely an ancient Berber language. I should search for languages related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and see if any are associated with the Liby\nAction 2: Search[Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages]\nObservation 2: Could not find Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages. Similar: ['Tugurt language', 'Ouargli language'].\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages\" did not yield direct results. However, it suggested \"Tugurt language\" and \"Ouargli language.\" These are likely related to the languages I'm looking for. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Berber script was used for Berber languages, I should investigate if Tugurt or Ouargli are related to the ancient varieties of Berber languages and if\nAction 3: Search[Ouargli language]\nObservation 3: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 4: The observation states that Ouargli is also known as Teggargrent, which is one of the languages mentioned in the question. It also mentions that speakers from Ouargla regard other varieties, including Tumzabt and Tugurt/Temacine, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This confirms that Ouargli (Teggargrent) and Tumzabt are closely related. The question also asks for a language traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-\nAction 4: Lookup[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The previous search for \"Libyco-Berber script\" did not yield further relevant information in the context of Ouargli. However, Observation 1 stated that the Libyco-Berber alphabet was used to write \"ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.\" Observation 3 confirmed that Ouargli (Teggargrent) is a Zenati Berber language and is closely related to Tumzabt. The question asks for a language traditionally written with the ancient Lib\nAction 5: Search[Numidian language]\nObservation 5: Numidian /n(j)u\u02d0\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259n/ was a language spoken in ancient Numidia. The script in which it was written, the Libyco-Berber alphabet (from which Tifinagh descended), has been almost fully deciphered and most characters (apart from a few exceptions restricted to specific areas) have known values. Libyco-Berber inscriptions are attested from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. As most surviving inscriptions are funerary steles with a simple format, only a few words have known meanings. The language can be confidently identified only as belonging to the Afroasiatic family, although it was likely part of the Berber languages, spoken at the start of the breakup of the Proto-Berber language, or possibly a sister branch to the modern Berber languages.[2][3][4].\nThought 6: Observation 5 states that Numidian was written in the Libyco-Berber alphabet and is considered to be part of the Berber languages, possibly a sister branch to modern Berber languages. Observation 3 confirmed that Ouargli (Teggargrent) and Tumzabt are closely related Zenati Berber languages. Therefore, Numidian, which was written with the Libyco-Berber script and is related to modern Berber languages, is the language that fits the description.\nAction 6: Finish[Numidian]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I should start by searching for \"ancient Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then look for languages related to it.\nAction 1: Search[ancient Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: Could not find ancient Libyco-Berber script. Similar: ['Libyco-Berber alphabet', 'Tifinagh (redirect from Berber script)', 'Berber languages', 'Proto-Sinaitic script', 'Zanata Stone'].\nThought 2: The previous search returned \"Libyco-Berber alphabet\" and \"Berber languages\". It's likely the script is related to Berber languages. I should search \"Berber languages\" to see if it mentions the ancient script and related languages like Tumzabt and Teggargrent.\nAction 2: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 2: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\nThought 3: The observation states that Berber languages were historically written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. It also mentions that Berber languages are closely related. However, it doesn't explicitly name a language that is written with this script AND is closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I need to find a specific Berber language that fits these criteria. I should search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to see if they are mentioned in relation to the Lib\nAction 3: yco-Berber script or other Berber languages.\nObservation 3: Invalid action: yco-Berber script or other Berber languages.\nThought 4: The previous observation mentioned \"Berber languages\" and I need to find a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I should search for Tumzabt and Teggargrent to see if they are identified as Berber languages, and if so, what their relationship is to other Berber languages and the Libyco-Berber script.\nAction 4: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 4: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 5: The observation states that Tumzabt (also known as Mozabite) is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites in Algeria. It's a Berber language. Now I need to do the same for Teggargrent and see if it's related to Tumzabt and if either is written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script.\nAction 5: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 5: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 6: The observation states that Teggargrent (Ouargli) is a Zenati Berber language and that speakers of Ouargla consider Tumzabt (Mozabite) as a dialect of a single language.

From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: What language, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages?\nThought 1: I need to find the language that is traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script and is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages. I will start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\" to understand its context and then search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to find their related languages.\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script. The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, which are also Berber languages. Therefore, I should search for information about Tumzabt and Teggargrent to see if they are related to Numidian or other ancient Berber languages. Since the question\nAction 2: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 2: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 3: Tumzabt is also known as Mozabite and is a Zenati language, part of the Mzab\u2013Wargla dialect cluster. The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, traditionally written with the Libyco-Berber script. I have found that Tumzabt is a Berber language. Now I need to find information about Teggargrent and its relation to Tumzabt and the Libyco-Berber script. I\nAction 3: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 3: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 4: The observation states that speakers from Ouargla (Teggargrent) regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine, and Tumzabt/Mozabite as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This implies that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related. The first observation mentioned that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian\nAction 4: Lookup[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The first observation mentioned that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The third observation states that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Zenati Berber languages and that speakers of Teggargrent consider them dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. This means that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages. Since the Libyco-Berber script was used for ancient\nAction 5: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 5: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\nThought 6: The previous observations established that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages. The first observation stated that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The fifth observation confirms that Berber languages have historically been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. Therefore, the language that is traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script and is closely related to Tumzabt and T\nAction 6: Search[Numidian language]\nObservation 6: Numidian /n(j)u\u02d0\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259n/ was a language spoken in ancient Numidia. The script in which it was written, the Libyco-Berber alphabet (from which Tifinagh descended), has been almost fully deciphered and most characters (apart from a few exceptions restricted to specific areas) have known values. Libyco-Berber inscriptions are attested from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. As most surviving inscriptions are funerary steles with a simple format, only a few words have known meanings. The language can be confidently identified only as belonging to the Afroasiatic family, although it was likely part of the Berber languages, spoken at the start of the breakup of the Proto-Berber language, or possibly a sister branch to the modern Berber languages.[2][3][4].\nThought 7: The first observation stated that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, such as the Numidian language. The sixth observation confirms that Numidian language is part of the Afroasiatic family and was likely part of the Berber languages. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are closely related Berber languages, and the Libyco-Berber script was used for ancient Berber languages like Numidian, Numidian is the language being asked about.\nAction 7: Finish[Numidian]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-\u0080\u00931846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: Who is the fictional head of a British Secret Service division and for which a one-time missionary was the inspiration for?\nThought 1: The question asks for two pieces of information: the fictional head of a British Secret Service division, and the inspiration for that character. I will first search for \"British Secret Service division\" to understand its fictional representations.\nAction 1: Search[British Secret Service division]\nObservation 1: Could not find British Secret Service division. Similar: ['MI6 (redirect from British Secret Service)', 'The Secret Service', 'British intelligence agencies', \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)\", 'Mansfield Smith-Cumming (category Chiefs of the Secret Intelligence Service)'].\nThought 2: The search for \"British Secret Service division\" did not yield direct results. However, \"MI6 (redirect from British Secret Service)\" is a strong lead. I will search for \"MI6\".\nAction 2: Search[MI6]\nObservation 2: The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6 (Military Intelligence, Section 6), is the foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, tasked mainly with the covert overseas collection and analysis of human intelligence on foreign nationals in support of its Five Eyes partners. SIS is one of the British intelligence agencies and the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (\"C\") is directly accountable to the Foreign Secretary.[4]. Formed in 1909 as the foreign section of the Secret Service Bureau, the section grew greatly during the First World War, officially adopting its current name around 1920.[5] The name \"MI6\" originated as a convenient label during the Second World War, when SIS was known by many names. It is still commonly used today.[5] The existence of SIS was not officially acknowledged until 1994.[6] That year the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (ISA) was introduced to Parliament, to place the organisation on a statutory footing for the first time. It provides the legal basis for its operations.\nThought 3: The current observation talks about MI6 and its chief, referred to as \"C\". This is a fictional head of a British Secret Service division. Now I need to find out for whom this character was inspired. I will search for \"C\" in the context of British Secret Service.\nAction 3: Lookup[C]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 778) The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6 (Military Intelligence, Section 6), is the foreign intelligence service of the United Kingdom, tasked mainly with the covert overseas collection and analysis of human intelligence on foreign nationals in support of its Five Eyes partners.\nThought 4: The previous lookup for \"C\" did not directly provide the inspiration. I need to find information linking the fictional head of MI6, \"C\", to a real-life inspiration, specifically a one-time missionary. I will try searching for \"MI6 C inspiration\" or similar. Since the previous search for \"C\" was too broad, I will try a more specific search related to the character.\nAction 4: Search[MI6 C fictional inspiration]\nObservation 4: Could not find MI6 C fictional inspiration. Similar: ['MI6', 'Q (James Bond) (category Fictional MI6 agents)', 'Control (fictional character)', 'Skyfall', 'M (James Bond) (category Fictional MI6 agents)'].\nThought 5: The search for \"MI6 C fictional inspiration\" was not successful. The similar results suggest looking into fictional MI6 agents or characters like \"M\" or \"Control\". Since the question specifies a *fictional head* and mentions a *one-time missionary* as inspiration, I should try to find information about the inspiration for the character \"M\" or \"C\" in James Bond films, as these are well-known fictional heads of MI6. I will try searching for \"inspiration\nAction 5: [M (James Bond)]\".\nObservation 5: Invalid action: [M (James Bond)]\".\nThought 6: The previous action was invalid. I need to search for \"M (James Bond)\" to find information about the inspiration for the character.\nAction 6: Search[M (James Bond)]\nObservation 6: M is a codename held by a fictional character in Ian Fleming's James Bond book and film series; the character is the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service for the agency known as MI6. Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the Eon Productions series of films, M has been portrayed by four actors: Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by John Huston, David Niven and Edward Fox.. Ian Fleming based much of M's character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who was Fleming's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War.\nThought 7: The observation states that Ian Fleming based M's character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who was Fleming's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division. It doesn't mention anything about a missionary. I need to find out if John Godfrey was a missionary or if the inspiration for the character \"C\" (as mentioned in an earlier observation) was a missionary. Since the earlier observation mentioned \"C\" as the head, and this one talks about \"M\", it's possible they are referring to\nAction 7: the same role or a similar one with different inspirations. I will search for \"Rear Admiral John Godfrey missionary\".\nObservation 7: Invalid action: the same role or a similar one with different inspirations. I will search for \"Rear Admiral John Godfrey missionary\".\n",

Similar: ['MI6 (redirect from British Secret Service)', 'Mossad (redirect from Israeli secret service)', 'Q (James Bond) (redirect from Q Division (James Bond))', 'The Interpreter (2005 film) (redirect from Ku (fictional language))', 'List of historical secret police organizations'].\nThought 2: The search for \"fictional head of British Secret Service division\" was too broad. I should search for a specific fictional head, and \"Q (James Bond)\" is a likely candidate as \"Q Division\" is mentioned. I will search for \"Q (James Bond)\".\nAction 2: Search[Q (James Bond)]\nObservation 2: Q is a character in the James Bond films and novelisations. Q is the head of Q Branch (later Q Division), the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Service charged with oversight of top secret field technologies.. Q (standing for quartermaster), like M, is a job title rather than a name. The use of letters as pseudonyms for senior officers in the British Secret Service was started by its first director, Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming (1859\u20131923), who signed himself with a C written in green ink.[1].

However, the previous observation for \"Q (James Bond)\" mentioned \"Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming (1859\u20131923), who signed himself with a C written in green ink.\" This suggests that \"Mansfield Smith-Cumming\" might be a more effective search term. I will search for \"Mansfield Smith-Cumming\" to find more information about\nAction 4: Search[Mansfield Smith-Cumming]\nObservation 4: Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming KCMG CB (1 April 1859[3] \u2013 14 June 1923) was a British naval officer who served as the first chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).. He was a great-great-grandson of the prominent merchant John Smith, a director of both the South Sea Company and the East India Company, the second son of Abel Smith (d. 1756), the Nottingham banker who founded a banking dynasty and whose business much later became National Westminster Bank, now one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom.[4] His father was Colonel John Thomas Smith of the Madras Royal Engineers who became Master of the Madras and Calcutta Mints and designed a machine for minting coins that was displayed at the Great Exhibition in 1851.[5]. Smith joined the Royal Navy and underwent training at Dartmouth from the age of twelve and was appointed acting sub-lieutenant in 1878. He was posted to HMS Bellerophon in 1877, and for the next seven years served in operations against Malay pirates (during 1875\u20136) and in Egypt in 1883.\nThought 5: The observation states that Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming served in operations against Malay pirates. It does not mention him being a missionary. The question asks for the inspiration for the character, and the previous observation stated that the job title Q was inspired by Smith-Cumming. However, the question specifically asks for inspiration for the *character*, and it also specifies \"a one-time missionary\". Since the current observation does not mention Smith-Cumming being a missionary, I need to see if\nAction 5: Lookup[missionary]\nObservation 5: No more results.\n\nThought 6: The observation for Mansfield Smith-Cumming does not mention him being a missionary. The question asks for the inspiration for the *character* (Q) who is the head of a British Secret Service division, and for whom a *one-time missionary* was the inspiration. Since the information about Smith-Cumming being a missionary is not found, I need to reconsider if there is another character that fits the description.

He held multiple world championships in four weight classes, from featherweight to light welterweight, including the lineal championship at lightweight.. In a career that spanned over twenty years, M\u00e1rquez was known for being a fast and highly technical boxer who was exceptionally skilled at combinations and counterpunches, yet also willing to engage in slugfests with opponents. He was also credited for his toughness, and never lost a fight by stoppage. His most notable bouts include his four-fight saga with Manny Pacquiao and his fight against fellow Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera..\nThought 2: The observation provides information about Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez's career but does not mention his brothers.

Given that the previous searches have not provided the answer, it's unlikely that further general searches for \"Eagle Aviation\" will be fruitful.

Surface water may be present, or water may only be accessible from wells or underground channels created by humans. In geography, an oasis may be a current or past rest stop on a transportation route, or less-than-verdant location that nonetheless provides access to underground water through deep wells created and maintained by humans. Although they depend on a natural condition, such as the presence of water that may be stored in reservoirs and used for irrigation, most oases, as we know them, are artificial.[2]. The word oasis came into English from Latin: oasis, from Ancient Greek: \u1f44\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \u00f3asis, which in turn is a direct borrowing from Demotic Egyptian.\nThought 2: The search for \"Oasis\" returned information about geographical oases, not the band. I need to search for the band \"Oasis\".\nAction 2: Search[Oasis (band)]\nObservation 2: Oasis are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam asked his older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became the de facto leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four studio albums.[1][2] They are regarded as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the Britpop genre.[3]. Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut studio album Definitely Maybe (1994), which topped the UK Albums Chart and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time.\nThought 3: The current observation mentions Tony McCarroll as the drummer. The question states that the song had an acoustic debut in Tony McCarroll's last concert. However, the observation does not mention any specific songs or concerts related to Tony McCarroll's departure. I need to find information about Tony McCarroll's last concert with Oasis and identify the song that had its acoustic debut there.\nAction 3: Lookup[Tony McCarroll]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 5) The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums).\nThought 4: The previous lookup for \"Tony McCarroll\" only confirmed his role as drummer. I need to find information about his departure or last concert and any associated song debuts.\nAction 4: Lookup[last concert]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The previous lookups did not yield information about Tony McCarroll's last concert or any song debuts associated with it. It's possible the information isn't directly linked to his name in a way that a simple lookup can find. I should try searching for information about Tony McCarroll's departure from Oasis and see if that leads to any details about his last performance and any songs played.\nAction 5: Search[Tony McCarroll departure Oasis]\nObservation 5: Could not find Tony McCarroll departure Oasis. Similar: [\"Oasis Live '25 Tour\", 'Alan White (Oasis drummer)', 'Oasis (band)', 'List of songs recorded by Oasis', 'Oasis discography'].\nThought 6: The search for \"Tony McCarroll departure Oasis\" did not yield direct results. The similar results suggest looking into other Oasis drummers or general band information. Since the question is about a specific hit single with an acoustic debut at Tony McCarroll's last concert, and I haven't found that information, I will try searching for \"Oasis hit singles\" and see if I can find a song that might fit the description or if any information about their early concerts and band member changes surfaces.\nAction 6: Search[Oasis hit singles]\nObservation 6: Could not find Oasis hit singles. Similar: ['Oasis discography', 'Live Forever (Oasis song)', 'Morning Glory (Oasis song)', 'Some Might Say (redirect from Headshrinker (Oasis song))', 'Supersonic (Oasis song)'].\nThought 7: The search for \"Oasis hit singles\" did not directly provide the answer. However, the similar results include specific song titles like \"Live Forever\", \"Morning Glory\", \"Some Might Say\", and \"Supersonic\". The original question asks about a hit single with an acoustic debut at Tony McCarroll's last concert. I need to investigate these songs or other early Oasis songs to see if any fit this description. Since I don't have specific information about Tony McCarroll's last concert\nAction 7: Search[Supersonic (Oasis song)]\nObservation 7: \"Supersonic\" is a song by English rock band Oasis, released as their debut single on 11 April 1994, and later appeared on their debut studio album, Definitely Maybe (1994). It was produced by the band and Mark Coyle, their live sound engineer. The single was accompanied by two music videos, one directed by Mark Szaszy and the other by Nick Egan.. \"Supersonic\" was written by lead guitarist Noel Gallagher and recorded in a single day at the Pink Museum Studio (now the Motor Museum) in Liverpool, England in mid-December 1993. Despite being technically a demo, it was never re-recorded, and it features Beatles-influenced backing vocals from Tony Griffiths of the band the Real People.\n",

Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.[3]. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric, grammar, and logic, and the quadrivium of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music.\nThought 4: The observation mentions that the liberal arts tradition includes the trivium (rhetoric, grammar, logic) and the quadrivium (astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, music). The question asks for three core subjects. The trivium subjects are often considered the foundational core of liberal arts. Therefore, rhetoric, grammar, and logic are likely the answer.\nAction 4: Finish[rhetoric, grammar, logic]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I should search for \"Duff McKagan\" to find more information about his role in those bands and his instruments.\nAction 4: Search[Duff McKagan]\nObservation 4: Michael Andrew \"Duff\" McKagan (born February 5, 1964) is an American musician. He was the bassist of hard rock band Guns N' Roses for twelve years, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. McKagan rejoined the band in 2016, following their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[1]. Toward the end of his first tenure with Guns N' Roses, McKagan released the solo album Believe in Me (1993) and formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders. Following his departure from Guns N' Roses in 1997, McKagan briefly reunited with his pre-success Seattle punk band 10 Minute Warning, before forming the still-active hard rock band Loaded, in which he performs lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\nThought 5: Duff McKagan is primarily known as a bassist, and he also plays rhythm guitar and performs lead vocals in his band Loaded. Since the observation for \"Kissed It\" mentions him as a featured musician alongside Slash (guitarist) and Matt Sorum (drummer), it's highly probable he played the bass guitar on the track. I will assume this and finish.\nAction 5: Finish[bass guitar]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

I will start by searching for \"Celtic languages survival\" or similar terms.\nAction 1: Search[Celtic languages survival]\nObservation 1: Could not find Celtic languages survival. Similar: ['Celtic nations', 'Celtic League', 'Celtic language decline in England', 'Gaulish (redirect from Gaulish languages)', 'Celts (redirect from Celtic people)'].\nThought 2: The search for \"Celtic languages survival\" did not yield direct results. I will try searching for \"Celtic nations\" as suggested by the similar entities. This might provide a list of regions where Celtic culture is present.\nAction 2: Search[Celtic nations]\nObservation 2: The Celtic nations or Celtic countries[1] are a cultural area and collection of geographical regions in Northwestern Europe where the Celtic languages and cultural traits have survived.[2] The term nation is used in its original sense to mean a people who share a common identity and culture and are identified with a traditional territory.[according to whom?]. The six regions widely considered Celtic countries in modern times are Brittany (Breizh), Cornwall (Kernow), Ireland (\u00c9ire), the Isle of Man (Mannin, or Ellan Vannin), Scotland (Alba), and Wales (Cymru).[1][3] In each of these six regions a Celtic language is spoken to some extent: Brittonic or Brythonic languages are spoken in Brittany (Breton), Cornwall (Cornish), and Wales (Welsh), whilst Goidelic or Gaelic languages are spoken in Scotland (Scottish Gaelic), Ireland (Irish), and the Isle of Man (Manx).[4]. Before the expansion of ancient Rome and the spread of Germanic and Slavic tribes, much of Europe was dominated by Celtic-speaking cultures, leaving behind a legacy of Celtic cultural traits.[5] Certain regions with evidence of Celtic influence in northwestern Iberia, such as Galicia, Asturias, northern Portugal, Le\u00f3n, and Cantabria (historically known as Gallaecia and Astures), are not typically considered Celtic nations.[6] Unlike the Insular Celtic languages, there's no record of Celtic languages surviving into the modern era in these regions.[6][7][8] Similar evidence of a pattern of Celtic influence without the long-term survival of Celtic languages is also found in various regions across Europe, including parts of Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic.. The concept of the Celtic nations is widely promoted by pan-Celtic movements, including political and cultural organizations like the Celtic League or International Celtic Congress.. Each of the six nations has its own Celtic language.\nThought 3: The observation lists six regions widely considered Celtic countries: Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland, and Wales. These are the territories where Celtic languages or cultural traits have survived.\nAction 3: Finish[Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

I should search for Joby Harold and see if any of his works are associated with Samuel Sim.\nAction 1: Search[Joby Harold]\nObservation 1: Joby Harold is an English screenwriter, producer and director who runs Safehouse Pictures with his producing partner, Tory Tunnell. The company was co-founded in 2005.. Harold's latest projects include Paramount's Novocaine (2025 film) starring Jack Quaid, Amber Midthunder, Ray Nicholson, and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen. Safehouse recently produced the A24 documentary Andre is an Idiot, which received a standing ovation at its premiere at the Sundance film festival where it was in dramatic competition. Harold's projects are the upcoming films Space Mountain [1] and Atlas[2] starring Jennifer Lopez, Simu Liu, and Sterling K.\nThought 2: The search for Joby Harold mentions \"Atlas\" starring Jennifer Lopez, Simu Liu, and Sterling K. It doesn't mention Samuel Sim or music. I need to see if \"Atlas\" is the film in question and if Samuel Sim wrote the music for it. I should search for \"Atlas\" film and see if Samuel Sim is credited for music.\nAction 2: Search[Atlas film]\nObservation 2: Could not find Atlas film. Similar: ['Atlas (2024 film)', 'Cloud Atlas (film)', 'Atlas Shrugged: Part I', 'Atlas Shrugged (film series)', 'Atlas (disambiguation)'].\nThought 3: The search for \"Atlas film\" did not yield direct results. However, it suggests \"Atlas (2024 film)\". I should search for this specific film and check if Joby Harold wrote and directed it, and if Samuel Sim wrote the music.\nAction 3: Search[Atlas (2024 film)]\nObservation 3: Atlas is a 2024 American science fiction action film starring Jennifer Lopez as a skilled counterterrorism analyst, who harbors a profound distrust of artificial intelligence, and who comes to realize that it may be her sole recourse following the failure of a mission aimed at apprehending a rogue robot. The film is directed by Brad Peyton and written by Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite. The film also stars Simu Liu, Sterling K. Brown, and Mark Strong.[3][4]. A co-production of ASAP Entertainment, Safehouse Pictures, Nuyorican Productions and Berlanti-Schechter Films, Atlas was released by Netflix on May 24, 2024.\nThought 4: The film \"Atlas (2024 film)\" was written by Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite, and directed by Brad Peyton. This does not match the criteria of being written and directed by Joby Harold. Therefore, the information about Joby Harold's involvement in \"Atlas\" from the previous search was likely about a different project or an earlier stage of development. Since the question asks for a film written and directed by Joby Harold with music by Samuel Sim, and \"Atlas\nAction 4: (2024 film)\" does not fit this, I need to re-evaluate. The initial search for Joby Harold did not mention Samuel Sim. I should search for Samuel Sim and look into his filmography to see if any of his works are associated with Joby Harold as writer/director.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: (2024 film)\" does not fit this, I need to re-evaluate. The initial search for Joby Harold did not mention Samuel Sim. I should search for Samuel Sim and look into his filmography to see if any of his works are associated with Joby Harold as writer/director.\nThought 5: The previous thought was trying to continue the last action which was invalid. I need to search for Samuel Sim to find his filmography and then check if any of his works match the criteria of being written and directed by Joby Harold.\nAction 5: Search[Samuel Sim]\nObservation 5: Samuel Sim is a British composer, record producer, musician and songwriter. His work spans concert music, recordings, arrangements and film and television scores. He writes in full orchestral as well as electronic and contemporary idioms, and is often known for his use of choir and vocal elements in his music.. Recent releases include the Ivor Novello Award nominated score for the Bafta Award winning series The Mill,[1] the multi-award-winning soundtrack for Home Fires,[2] released 6 May 2016 by Sony Classical Records.[3] and the music to The Halcyon released by Decca Records in January 2017.[4]. Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us.\nThought 6: The search for Samuel Sim provides his profession (composer) and some of his works (The Mill, Home Fires, The Halcyon). It does not mention any films written and directed by Joby Harold. I need to find a film associated with both Joby Harold (as writer/director) and Samuel Sim (as composer). Since the previous searches did not yield a direct match, I should try searching for Joby Harold again and look for any mention of his directorial or writing credits for films where\nAction 6: Samuel Sim composed the music.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: samuel Sim composed the music.\nThought 7: The previous thought was incomplete. I need to search for Joby Harold again, specifically looking for his directorial or writing credits for films where Samuel Sim composed the music. The previous search for Joby Harold mentioned \"Atlas\" and \"Novocaine\" but did not mention Samuel Sim. I need to investigate these films further to see if Samuel Sim was involved. I will start by searching for \"Joby Harold Atlas\" and \"Joby Harold Novocaine\" to see if Samuel Sim is mentioned in relation\nAction 7: to them.\nObservation 7: Invalid action: to them.\n",

Safehouse recently produced the A24 documentary Andre is an Idiot, which received a standing ovation at its premiere at the Sundance film festival where it was in dramatic competition. Harold's projects are the upcoming films Space Mountain [1] and Atlas[2] starring Jennifer Lopez, Simu Liu, and Sterling K.\nThought 2: The observation mentions \"Atlas\" starring Jennifer Lopez and Simu Liu, and \"Space Mountain\" as upcoming films. It also mentions \"Novocaine\" as a film directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen. I need to find out which of these, if any, had music written by Samuel Sim, and also confirm if Joby Harold wrote and directed it. Since the observation doesn't directly state the composer for these films, I will search for \"Samuel Sim\" and see if any of these\nAction 2: Search[Samuel Sim]\nObservation 2: Samuel Sim is a British composer, record producer, musician and songwriter. His work spans concert music, recordings, arrangements and film and television scores. He writes in full orchestral as well as electronic and contemporary idioms, and is often known for his use of choir and vocal elements in his music..

Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us.\nThought 3: The observation for Samuel Sim lists several works, but none of the films mentioned in the Joby Harold search (Atlas, Space Mountain, Novocaine). I need to find a connection between Joby Harold's films and Samuel Sim's music. I will try searching for \"Joby Harold Samuel Sim\" to see if there's any direct mention of them collaborating.\nAction 3: Search[Joby Harold Samuel Sim]\nObservation 3: Could not find Joby Harold Samuel Sim.

However, the previous searches did not confirm that Joby Harold wrote and directed the films, nor did they confirm Samuel Sim as the composer. I need to find a film that Joby Harold wrote and directed, and then check its composer. Since the previous search for Joby Harold mentioned \"Atlas\" and \"Space Mountain\" as upcoming projects, and \"Novocaine\" as a directed film by others, I will try\nAction 4: Search[Atlas film Joby Harold]\nObservation 4: Could not find Atlas film Joby Harold.

A co-production of ASAP Entertainment, Safehouse Pictures, Nuyorican Productions and Berlanti-Schechter Films, Atlas was released by Netflix on May 24, 2024.\nThought 6: The observation states that \"Atlas\" was directed by Brad Peyton and written by Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite. This means Joby Harold did not write and direct it. Therefore, \"Atlas\" is not the film I'm looking for. I need to go back and check other films associated with Joby Harold or look for other possibilities. I will search for \"Joby Harold director\" to confirm his directorial work.\nAction 6: Search[Joby Harold director]\nObservation 6: Could not find Joby Harold director.

The similar results mention films he wrote screenplays for, such as \"Awake (2007 film)\", \"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\", and \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\". I need to find a film that Joby Harold *wrote and directed*, and then check for Samuel Sim's music.

If not, I will have to conclude that the information is not available.\nAction 4: Search[Louis Armstrong discography]\nObservation 4: Louis Armstrong (1901\u20131971), nicknamed Satchmo[1] or Pops, was an American trumpeter, composer, singer and occasional actor who was one of the most influential figures in jazz and in all of American popular music. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz.[2]. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.[3] With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing.. Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.\nThought 5: Louis Armstrong's career spanned from the 1920s to the 1960s. The observation does not mention the song \"Would You Like to Take a Walk?\" or any specific recordings from 1951. It seems unlikely that Louis Armstrong recorded this song in 1951.

They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct..\nThought 2: Sporobolus is a genus of plants in the grass family.

However, it suggested \"Maize (redirect from Zea mays)\". \"Zea mays\" is the scientific name for maize, or corn. I should search for \"Zea mays\" to confirm its family.\nAction 3: Search[Zea mays]\nObservation 3: Maize (/me\u026az/; Zea mays), also known as corn in North American English, is a tall stout grass that produces cereal grain. It was domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago from wild teosinte. Native Americans planted it alongside beans and squashes in the Three Sisters polyculture. The leafy stalk of the plant gives rise to male inflorescences or tassels which produce pollen, and female inflorescences called ears. The ears yield grain, known as kernels or seeds.\nThought 4: The current observation states that maize (Zea mays) is a tall stout grass. In Thought 2, I learned that Sporobolus is a genus of plants in the grass family. Since Zea mays is a grass, and Sporobolus is in the grass family, they are both grasses. Therefore, they are in the same family, which is the grass family.\nAction 4: Finish[grass family]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois.[2] Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3]. Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician.

I will start by searching for \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\".\nAction 1: Search[Livesey Hal War Memorial]\nObservation 1: Could not find Livesey Hal War Memorial. Similar: ['Danny Glover filmography', 'Deborah Kerr', 'List of Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign non-political endorsements', 'James Stewart (category Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale))', 'Michael Gough'].\nThought 2: The search for \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\" did not yield results. It's possible there's a misspelling or the memorial is not widely documented on Wikipedia under this exact name. Given the question asks about a war with over 60 million casualties, World War II is a strong candidate for this casualty count. I will search for \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\" again, but also consider searching for information about war memorials in general or specifically memorials related to wars with high casualties,\nAction 2: Search[Livesey]\nObservation 2: 53\u00b043\u203220\u2033N 2\u00b031\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff53.7222\u00b0N 2.5168\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.7222; -2.5168. Livesey is a civil parish in the unitary borough of Blackburn with Darwen, in the ceremonial county of Lancashire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 6,202.[1]. Its name likeliest came from Old English L\u0113ofes \u012beg = \"L\u0113of's island\" or L\u0113ofsiges \u012beg = \"L\u0113ofsige's island\", where, as often in place names of Old English origin, \"island\" here means \"low-lying flat land by a river\" (here the River Darwen).[citation needed]. Lying to the south west of Blackburn, Livesey contains most of the suburb of  Cherry Tree, including its railway station and the majority of the village of Feniscowles.\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\" failed. The current search for \"Livesey\" provides information about a civil parish in Lancashire, England. It mentions its location and etymology but not a war memorial. The question asks about a war with over 60 million casualties, which strongly points to World War II. It's possible the memorial is named after a location related to the war or a person associated with it. I should try to find a war memorial in Livesey\nAction 3: Lookup[war memorial]\nObservation 3: No more results.\n\nThought 4: The search for \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\" failed, and looking up \"war memorial\" in the context of \"Livesey\" did not yield relevant information. The question also specifies a war with over 60 million casualties, which is a very distinctive characteristic of World War II. It's highly probable that the memorial commemorates fallen soldiers from World War II. Given the lack of specific information about the \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\", I will proceed with the assumption that it commemorates World War\nAction 4: Search[World War II]\nObservation 4: Mediterranean and Middle East. World War\u00a0II[b] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 \u2013 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians.\nThought 5: The search results for \"World War II\" indicate that it caused 70 to 85 million deaths, which aligns with the \"over 60 million casualties\" part of the question. Since the \"Livesey Hal War Memorial\" could not be found directly, and the casualty count strongly suggests World War II, it's the most logical answer.\nAction 5: Finish[World War II]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",

[12-cwt.]) was a common, versatile 3-inch (76.2\u00a0mm) calibre naval gun introduced in 1894 and used until the middle of the 20th century.[4] It was produced by Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick and used on Royal Navy warships, exported to allied countries, and used for land service.[4] In British service \"12-pounder\" was the rounded value of the projectile weight, and \"12 cwt (hundredweight)\" was the weight of the barrel and breech, to differentiate it from other \"12-pounder\" guns.. As the Type 41 3-inch (7.62\u00a0cm)/40 it was used on most early battleships and cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, though it was commonly referred to by its UK designation as a \"12-pounder\" gun. Italy built guns under licence as the 76.2\u00a0mm/40 (3\") by Ansaldo..\nThought 4: The observation does not state whether this gun is air-cooled. I will search for the other weapons listed.

It was widely produced by Oerlikon Contraves and others, with various models employed by both Allied and Axis forces during World War II. Many versions of the cannon are still used.[2][3]. During World War I, the German industrialist Reinhold Becker developed a 20 mm caliber cannon, known now as the 20 mm Becker using the advanced primer ignition blowback (API blowback) method of operation. This used a 20\u00d770mmRB cartridge and had a cyclic rate of fire of 300 rpm.\nThought 6: The observation does not state if the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon is air-cooled. I will now search for the \".303-inch Vickers machine gun\".\nAction 6: Search[.303-inch Vickers machine gun]\nObservation 6: Could not find .303-inch Vickers machine gun.

I will search for this.\nAction 7: Search[Vickers machine gun]\nObservation 7: The Vickers machine gun or Vickers gun is a water-cooled .303 British (7.7\u00a0mm) machine gun produced by Vickers Limited, originally for the British Army. The gun was operated by a three-man crew but typically required more men to move and operate it: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the others helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition, and spare parts.[18] It was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft.. The weapon had a reputation for great solidity and reliability. Ian V. Hogg, in Weapons & War Machines, describes an action that took place in August 1916, during which the British 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps fired their ten Vickers guns to deliver sustained fire for twelve hours.\n",

First, I need to search for HMAS \"Narani\" to identify the weapon system.\nAction 1: Search[HMAS Narani]\nObservation 1: HMAS Narani was an auxiliary minesweeper operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during World War II. Narani was requisitioned from the Illawarra & South Coast Steam Navigation Company as auxiliaries. The 381-ton vessel was armed with a 12-pounder 12cwt QF gun, a 20mm Oerlikon cannon, a .303-inch Vickers machine gun, and four Type D depth charges, and was commissioned into the RAN on 11 June 1941.. During the war, Narani, Uki, and Bermagui made up Group 77 Minesweeper, based at HMAS Maitland, in Newcastle, New South Wales.. Returned to her owners on 10 July 1946, she plied the coastal trade until 1951 when she was sold to New Guinea Borneo Mangrove Co., Port Moresby.\nThought 2: The HMAS Narani was armed with a 12-pounder 12cwt QF gun, a 20mm Oerlikon cannon, and a .303-inch Vickers machine gun. I need to determine which of these weapon systems had an air-cooled version and where it was found. I will start by searching for \"12-pounder 12cwt QF gun\".\nAction 2: Search[12-pound\nObservation 2: Invalid action: search[12-pound\nThought 3: The search term was invalid.

I should investigate \"QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun\" to see if it's the same weapon and if it has an air-cooled version.\nAction 4: Search[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun]\nObservation 4: The QF 12-pounder 12-cwt gun (Quick-Firing) (abbreviated as Q.F. 12-pdr. [12-cwt.]) was a common, versatile 3-inch (76.2\u00a0mm) calibre naval gun introduced in 1894 and used until the middle of the 20th century.[4] It was produced by Armstrong Whitworth, Elswick and used on Royal Navy warships, exported to allied countries, and used for land service.[4] In British service \"12-pounder\" was the rounded value of the projectile weight, and \"12 cwt (hundredweight)\" was the weight of the barrel and breech, to differentiate it from other \"12-pounder\" guns.. As the Type 41 3-inch (7.62\u00a0cm)/40 it was used on most early battleships and cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, though it was commonly referred to by its UK designation as a \"12-pounder\" gun. Italy built guns under licence as the 76.2\u00a0mm/40 (3\") by Ansaldo..\nThought 5: The QF 12-pounder 12-cwt gun was a naval gun. The question asks about a weapon system used on HMAS \"Narani\" and its air-cooled version. The observation does not specify if this gun has an air-cooled version, nor does it mention where it was found. I need to continue investigating the weapon systems on HMAS \"Narani\". I will now search for the next weapon system listed for HMAS Narani: \"2\nAction 5: Lookup[20mm Oerlikon cannon]\nObservation 5: No more results.\n\nThought 6: I have searched for the weapon systems listed for HMAS Narani. The first weapon system, \"12-pounder 12cwt QF gun\", was searched as \"QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun\" and the observation did not mention an air-cooled version or where it was found. The second weapon system, \"20mm Oerlikon cannon\", did not yield any results from the lookup. This suggests that the information about\nAction 6: the air-cooled version of a weapon system on HMAS \"Narani\" and where it was found might not be available through these searches. Given the lack of information, I will consider other possibilities or conclude that the information is not available.

I will search for \"BMW X5\" and look for information about models produced alongside it in 2009.\nAction 1: Search[BMW X5]\nObservation 1: The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by BMW.[1] The X5 made its debut in 1999 as the E53 model. It was BMW's first SUV. At launch, it featured all-wheel drive and was available with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The second generation was launched in 2006, and was known internally as the E70. The E70 featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic gearbox.\nThought 2: The observation mentions the second generation X5 (E70) was launched in 2006.

I need to re-evaluate my strategy. The question asks about a \"newer model\" produced alongside the BMW X5 in 2009. The previous search for \"BMW X5\" mentioned the second generation (E70) was launched in 2006. It is possible that the \"newer model\" refers to a different generation or a related model that was introduced or produced in 2009.

Each installment is typically a crime drama, with plot lines inspired by yakuza films and pre-millennial Japanese crime dramas. The most frequently featured protagonist is Kazuma Kiryu, a reformed yakuza associated with the Kanto-based Tojo Clan.

Bilbo was a demagogue and filibusterer whose name was synonymous with white supremacy.[1] Like many Southern Democrats of his era, Bilbo believed that black people were inferior; he defended segregation, and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the United States' largest white supremacist terrorist organization.[2][3][4] He also published a pro-segregation work, Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization.. Bilbo was educated in rural Hancock County (later Pearl River County). He attended Peabody Normal College in Nashville, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University Law School.\nThought 3: The observation mentions that Bilbo was a \"demagogue and filibusterer\".

Given the context of politics and his demagogue nature, \"demagogue\" seems to be a key descriptor of his mastery in public speaking and manipulation. I will search for \"demagogue\" to see if it fits the question's intent.\nAction 4: Lookup[demagogue]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 1) Bilbo was a demagogue and filibusterer whose name was synonymous with white supremacy.[1] Like many Southern Democrats of his era, Bilbo believed that black people were inferior; he defended segregation, and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the United States' largest white supremacist terrorist organization.[2][3][4] He also published a pro-segregation work, Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization..\nThought 5: The text states that Bilbo was a \"demagogue and filibusterer\". While \"demagogue\" describes his political style, the question asks what he was a \"master of\". The term \"Pastemaster General\" is a direct quote that suggests mastery, even if it's a pun. I will go with \"Pastemaster General\" as it is a more direct answer to being a \"master of something\".\nAction 5: Finish[Pastemaster General]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

It was an essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore an image of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin, called in Latin laserpicium, lasarpicium, or laser (Laserpitium and Laser were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera).. The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It was claimed to have become extinct in Roman times,[3] but is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula.[1][4][5] The extant plant Thapsia gummifera[6] has been suggested as another possibility.\nThought 2: The first observation states that Silphium is an unidentified plant and is believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula. It also mentions that Laserpitium and Laser were used to name genera of aromatic plants. However, it doesn't explicitly state that Silphium is a genus of flowering plants. I need to search for \"Heliotropium\" to see if it is a genus of flowering plants.\nAction 2: Search[Heliotropium]\nObservation 2: 250-300, see text. Heliotropium /\u02cchi\u02d0li\u0259\u02c8tro\u028api\u0259m, -lio\u028a-/[3] is a genus of flowering plants traditionally included in the family Boraginaceae s.l., but placed in the family Heliotropiaceae within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group..[4]  There are around 325 species in this almost cosmopolitan genus,[5] which are commonly known as heliotropes. They are highly toxic to dogs and cats, as well as to humans.[6]. The name \"heliotrope\"  derives from the old idea that the inflorescences of these plants turned their rows of flowers to the Sun.[7] \u1f2d\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (helios) is Greek for \"Sun\", \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (trepein) means \"to turn\". The Middle English name \"turnsole\" has the same meaning.[8].\nThought 3: The second observation clearly states that Heliotropium is a genus of flowering plants. Now I need to re-examine the first observation to determine if Silphium is also a genus of flowering plants. The first observation mentions that \"Laserpitium and Laser were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera.\" It also states that Silphium is an unidentified plant and is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel\nAction 3: Lookup[genus]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 5) Heliotropium /\u02cchi\u02d0li\u0259\u02c8tro\u028api\u0259m, -lio\u028a-/[3] is a genus of flowering plants traditionally included in the family Boraginaceae s.l., but placed in the family Heliotropiaceae within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group..[4]  There are around 325 species in this almost cosmopolitan genus,[5] which are commonly known as heliotropes.\nThought 4: The first observation is still unclear about whether Silphium is a genus of flowering plants. I need to find more information about Silphium's classification.\nAction 4: Search[Silphium genus]\nObservation 4: Could not find Silphium genus. Similar: ['Silphium (genus)', 'Silphium', 'Silphium integrifolium', 'Silphium perfoliatum', 'Silphium laciniatum'].\nThought 5: The search for \"Silphium genus\" did not yield a direct answer. However, the similar results suggest searching for \"Silphium (genus)\". I will try that.\nAction 5: Search[Silphium (genus)]\nObservation 5: Silphium is a genus of North American plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.[1][2]. Members of the genus, commonly known as rosinweeds, are herbaceous perennial plants growing to 0.2\u00a0m (8\u00a0in) to more than 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) tall, with yellow (rarely white) flowerheads that resemble sunflowers. In the rosinweeds, the ray florets in the head are female and the disc florets are male;[3] this differs from sunflowers, where ray florets are sterile and disc florets are perfect, capable of producing both pollen and seeds.[4]. The name of the genus comes from the Ancient Greek word for a North African plant whose identity has been lost, though it is known its gum or juice was prized by the ancients as a medicine and a condiment.[3]. Species in the genus include:[5][3][6][7][8][9].\nThought 6: The observation states that Silphium is a genus of North American plants in the family Asteraceae. Asteraceae is a family of flowering plants. Therefore, Silphium is a genus of flowering plants. Heliotropium is also a genus of flowering plants. So, both genera are genera of flowering plants.\nAction 6: Finish[yes]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",

Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-\u0080\u00931846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: Are both genera Silphium and Heliotropium, genera of flowering plants ?\nThought 1: I need to determine if both Silphium and Heliotropium are genera of flowering plants. I will search for each genus and check their classification.\nAction 1: Search[Silphium]\nObservation 1: Silphium (also known as laserwort or laser; Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, s\u00edlphion) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.[1][2]. It was an essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore an image of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin, called in Latin laserpicium, lasarpicium, or laser (Laserpitium and Laser were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera).. The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It was claimed to have become extinct in Roman times,[3] but is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula.[1][4][5] The extant plant Thapsia gummifera[6] has been suggested as another possibility.\nThought 2: The search result for Silphium does not explicitly state it is a genus of flowering plants, but mentions it as an \"unidentified plant\" and a \"relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula\". This is not enough to confirm it is a flowering plant genus. I need to search for Heliotropium.\nAction 2: Search[Heliotropium]\nObservation 2: 250-300, see text. Heliotropium /\u02cchi\u02d0li\u0259\u02c8tro\u028api\u0259m, -lio\u028a-/[3] is a genus of flowering plants traditionally included in the family Boraginaceae s.l., but placed in the family Heliotropiaceae within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group..[4]  There are around 325 species in this almost cosmopolitan genus,[5] which are commonly known as heliotropes. They are highly toxic to dogs and cats, as well as to humans.[6]. The name \"heliotrope\"  derives from the old idea that the inflorescences of these plants turned their rows of flowers to the Sun.[7] \u1f2d\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (helios) is Greek for \"Sun\", \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (trepein) means \"to turn\". The Middle English name \"turnsole\" has the same meaning.[8].\nThought 3: The search for Heliotropium states it is a \"genus of flowering plants\". Now I need to go back to Silphium and confirm if it is a genus of flowering plants. The previous search for Silphium was inconclusive. I will try searching for \"Silphium genus flowering plant\".\nAction 3: Search[Silphium genus flowering plant]\nObservation 3: Could not find Silphium genus flowering plant. Similar: ['Silphium laciniatum', 'Silphium perfoliatum', 'Silphium integrifolium', 'Silphium radula', 'Silphium mohrii'].\nThought 4: The search for \"Silphium genus flowering plant\" did not yield a direct answer. However, the similar results provided are species names like \"Silphium laciniatum\", \"Silphium perfoliatum\", etc. The presence of species names strongly suggests that Silphium is indeed a genus. Given that Heliotropium is confirmed as a genus of flowering plants, and Silphium is likely a genus (implied by species names), I will assume Silphium is also\nAction 4: a genus of flowering plants. Therefore, the answer is yes.\nObservation 4: Invalid action: a genus of flowering plants. Therefore, the answer is yes.\nThought 5: The previous action was to state the answer, but it was an incomplete thought. I need to confirm if Silphium is a genus of flowering plants. The search results for Silphium mention it as an \"unidentified plant\" and a \"relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula\". This is not a direct confirmation. However, the similar results provided were species names (e.g., Silphium laciniatum), which strongly implies Silphium is a genus. Since Heli\nAction 5: Search[Silphium]\nObservation 5: Silphium (also known as laserwort or laser; Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, s\u00edlphion) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.[1][2].

However, the search for Heliotropium confirmed it is a genus of flowering plants. I need to find definitive information about Silphium being a genus of flowering plants. I will try searching for \"Silphium plant classification\".\nAction 6: Search[Silphium plant classification]\nObservation 6: Could not find Silphium plant classification. Similar: ['Silphium perfoliatum', 'Silphium integrifolium', 'Silphium laciniatum', 'Silphium terebinthinaceum', 'Silphium asteriscus'].\nThought 7: The search results for Silphium are still not conclusive. However, the similar results are all species of Silphium, which strongly indicates that Silphium is a genus. Since Heliotropium is confirmed to be a genus of flowering plants, and Silphium is very likely a genus (based on the species names), I can conclude that both are genera of flowering plants.\nAction 7: Finish[yes]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",

Initially an extratropical cyclone, the storm absorbed Hurricane Grace to its south and evolved into a small unnamed hurricane later in its life. Damage from the storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD)[2] and thirteen people were killed in total, six of which were an outcome of the sinking of Andrea Gail, which inspired the book and later movie, The Perfect Storm.

He wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\", which also starred Jerry Orbach. The question asks about film adaptations that both Jerome Bernard and Ira Lewis have in common. Since \"Jerome Bernard\" did not yield relevant results, and \"Jerry Orbach\" (potentially related to \"Jerome Bernard Orbach\") was in the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\" with Ira Lewis, it is highly probable that \"Jerome\nAction 6: Bernard\" refers to \"Jerry Orbach\".

He is known for the play \"Chinese Coffee\", which was adapted into a film in 2000. The film starred Al Pacino and Jerry Orbach. The search for Jerome Bernard did not yield any information about film adaptations. It's possible that \"Jerome Bernard\" is not a recognized figure in film, or the name is misspelled, or the question is based on a false premise.\nAction 4: Search[Jerry Orbach]\nObservation 4: Jerome Bernard Orbach (October 20, 1935 \u2013 December 28, 2004) was an American actor and singer, described at the time of his death as \"one of the last bona fide leading men of the Broadway musical and global celebrity on television\"[1] and a \"versatile stage and film actor.\"[2] Over his career he received a Tony Award and Screen Actors Guild Award as well as nominations for three Emmy Awards and a Grammy Award.. Orbach's career began on the New York stage, both on and off-Broadway, where he created roles such as El Gallo in the original off-Broadway run of The Fantasticks (1960) where he was the first performer to sing that show's standard \"Try to Remember.\"[3] He won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for playing Chuck Baxter in the musical Promises, Promises (1968\u20131972).[4] He was Tony-nominated for portraying Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls (1965) and Billy Flynn in the original Chicago (1976). He also acted in Annie Get Your Gun (1966) and 42nd Street (1980).. He gained worldwide fame for starring as NYPD Detective Lennie Briscoe on the NBC legal drama Law & Order from 1992 to 2004.[5] For the role he earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He reprised the role across several series including Homicide: Life on the Street (1996\u20131999), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999\u20132000), Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), and Law & Order: Trial by Jury (2005).\nThought 5: The search for Jerome Bernard did not yield any relevant information about film adaptations. However, the search for Ira Lewis mentioned that he wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee,\" which also starred Jerry Orbach. The search for Jerry Orbach confirms he was an actor and singer who appeared in films. The question asks for a film adaptation that both Jerome Bernard and Ira Lewis have in common. Since \"Jerome Bernard\" does not appear to be connected to any film adaptations based on the searches\nAction 5: I have not found any film adaptation that Jerome Bernard has in common with Ira Lewis. The search for Jerome Bernard did not yield any relevant information about film adaptations. It is possible that the question is based on a false premise, or the name \"Jerome Bernard\" is incorrect or refers to someone not known for film work. Given the lack of information for Jerome Bernard, I cannot determine a common film adaptation.\nObservation 5: Invalid action: i have not found any film adaptation that Jerome Bernard has in common with Ira Lewis.

It is possible that the question is based on a false premise, or the name \"Jerome Bernard\" is incorrect or refers to someone not known for film work. Given the lack of information for Jerome Bernard, I cannot determine a common film adaptation.\nThought 6: The previous search for \"Jerome Bernard\" did not yield any relevant information about film adaptations. The similar entities suggested \"Jerry Orbach (redirect from Jerome Bernard Orbach)\". This implies that \"Jerome Bernard\" might be an alternative name or a part of the name \"Jerry Orbach\". The search for Ira Lewis mentioned that Ira Lewis wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\", which also starred Jerry Orbach. Therefore, it is highly probable that \"Jerome Bernard\" refers\nAction 6: to Jerry Orbach. Thus, both Ira Lewis and Jerry Orbach (Jerome Bernard) have the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\" in common.\nObservation 6: Invalid action: to Jerry Orbach. Thus, both Ira Lewis and Jerry Orbach (Jerome Bernard) have the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\" in common.\nThought 7: The previous thought process identified that \"Jerome Bernard\" might refer to \"Jerry Orbach\". Ira Lewis wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee,\" and Jerry Orbach starred in it.

Create account.\nThought 2: Jerome Bernard is a racing cyclist. I need to search Ira Lewis next. The question asks about film adaptations, so I should look for film-related information for both individuals.\nAction 2: Search[Ira Lewis]\nObservation 2: Ira Lewis Metsky  (27 August 1932 \u2013 4 April 2015) was an American actor, writer, and playwright. Lewis was best known for his one-act play, Chinese Coffee, which opened at the Circle in the Square Theatre in 1992, starring Al Pacino.[1] A film adaptation of Chinese Coffee, also starring Pacino, as well as Jerry Orbach, was released in 2000.[1] Ira Lewis wrote the film's screenplay, while Pacino directed the adaptation.[1]. Lewis was born on August 27, 1932, in Newark, New Jersey. He studied acting and made his Broadway debut in Arthur Miller\u2019s Incident at Vichy. In 1965, Lewis toured with a production of Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night.[2].\nThought 3: Ira Lewis is an actor, writer, and playwright, and he wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of \"Chinese Coffee\". I need to find out if Jerome Bernard has any connection to film adaptations. Since the first search for \"Jerome Bernard\" yielded no information about film adaptations, I will try searching for \"Jerome Bernard film\".\nAction 3: Search[Jerome Bernard film]\nObservation 3: Could not find Jerome Bernard film. Similar: ['Jerry Orbach (redirect from Jerome Bernard Orbach)', 'Liberty Belle (film)', 'J\u00e9r\u00f4me Robart', 'Gerome Ragni (redirect from Jerome Bernard Ragni)', 'J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kircher'].\nThought 4: The search for \"Jerome Bernard film\" did not yield relevant results. The similar entities suggest a possible confusion or a lack of information linking \"Jerome Bernard\" to film adaptations. Given that Ira Lewis has a clear connection to a film adaptation (\"Chinese Coffee\"), and there's no indication of Jerome Bernard having any film work, it's unlikely they have a film adaptation in common. Therefore, the answer should be null as I cannot find any film adaptation that Jerome Bernard is associated with.\nAction 4: Finish[null]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

It is based on the story of Operation Cowboy which was the evacuation of 70 Lipizzaner horses from the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and retrieval of 300 Lipizzaner horses from a breeding farm in Czechoslovakia. The prized Lipizzaner horses were Austrian national treasures in danger of being used for food supply by the advancing Soviet Army during World War II. To gain Patton's aid, Podhajsky and his team from the Spanish Riding School of Vienna perform for Patton with their Lipizzaner stallions a precision dressage exhibition and the individual \"Airs Above the Ground\" with the hope Patton will see the value of horses and help rescue the mares and foals in Czechoslovakia.. Major parts of the movie were shot at the Hermesvilla palace in the Lainzer Tiergarten of Vienna, a former hunting area for the Habsburg nobility.\nThought 5: Miracle of the White Stallions was released in 1963.

Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay written by Tab Murphy, Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and the writing team of Bob Tzudiker and Noni White, it stars the voices of Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Tony Jay, and Kevin Kline. The film follows Quasimodo (Hulce), the deformed and confined bell-ringer of Notre Dame, and his yearning to explore the outside world and be accepted by society, against the wishes of his cruel, puritanical foster father Claude Frollo (Jay), who also wants to exterminate Paris' Romani population.. In 1993, David Stainton, then a development executive at Disney Feature Animation, conceived the idea to adapt Victor Hugo's Gothic fiction novel into an animated feature. He subsequently pitched the idea to then-Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg.\nThought 7: The 1996 animated film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" was released in 1996. The film \"Miracle of the White Stallions\" was released in 1963.

This college also functioned as a female coordinate institution for Harvard College. I need to search for Jennifer Gordon and her educational background, specifically looking for a college that fits the description.\nAction 1: Search[Jennifer Gordon]\nObservation 1: Jennifer Gordon founded the Workplace Project in 1992, a non-profit worker center in Hempstead, New York, which organizes immigrant workers, mostly from Central and South America. The Workplace Project lobbied for and won a strong wage enforcement law in New York state. Gordon was the executive director of the Workplace Project from 1993 to 1998. Gordon was a MacArthur Fellow from 1999 to 2004. She is the author of Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights, as well as several articles on immigrants, politics, and labor unions.\nThought 2: The observation about Jennifer Gordon does not mention her educational background or any college she attended. I need to find a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that served as a coordinate institution for Harvard College. I can search for \"women's liberal arts college Cambridge Massachusetts coordinate institution Harvard College\".\nAction 2: Search[women's liberal arts college Cambridge Massachusetts coordinate institution Harvard College]\nObservation 2: Could not find women's liberal arts college Cambridge Massachusetts coordinate institution Harvard College. Similar: ['Seven Sisters (colleges)', 'Wellesley College', 'Smith College', 'Williams College', 'Boston College'].\nThought 3: The similar entities suggest that I should look into the \"Seven Sisters (colleges)\" as they are a group of women's liberal arts colleges. One of these might be located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and historically served as a coordinate institution for Harvard. I will search for \"Seven Sisters (colleges)\" to learn more about them.\nAction 3: Search[Seven Sisters (colleges)]\nObservation 3: The Seven Sisters are a group of seven private liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States that are historically women's colleges.[1][2] Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College are still women's colleges. Vassar College became coeducational in 1969 and Radcliffe College's undergraduate functions were absorbed in 1999 by Harvard College, also continuing on as the Harvard Radcliffe Institute.. The name Seven Sisters is a reference to the Greek myth of the Pleiades, goddesses immortalized as stars in the sky:[1] Maia, Electra, Taygete, Alcyone, Celaeno, Sterope, and Merope.[2]. These colleges were created in the 19th century to provide women with the educational equivalent to the historically all-male Ivy League colleges. (Cornell, one of the eight Ivy League schools, has been open to accepting women since its founding, and admitted Jennie Spencer in 1870.).\nThought 4: The observation mentions Radcliffe College's undergraduate functions were absorbed by Harvard College. Radcliffe College was historically a women's college associated with Harvard. I need to confirm if Radcliffe College is a liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts and if Jennifer Gordon attended it. Since the previous search for Jennifer Gordon did not yield her educational background, I will focus on confirming Radcliffe College's location and its liberal arts status.\nAction 4: Search[Radcliffe College]\nObservation 4: Radcliffe College was a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that was founded in 1879.

He was CEO of Enron subsidiaries Enron Energy Services[5] and Enron Xcelerator, a venture capital division.[2] He left Enron with over $250 million. Pai was the second-largest land owner in Colorado after he purchased the 77,500-acre (314\u00a0km2) Taylor Ranch[6] for $23 million in 1999,[7] though he sold the property in June 2004 for $60 million.[8]. Pai was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing in the Enron scandal and exercised his Fifth Amendment rights in regard to the subsequent Enron class action lawsuits.[9] As a result of the lawsuit, Pai forfeited $6 million due to him from Enron's insurance policy for company officers to a fund for Enron shareholders.[10][11]. Accounts of the Enron scandal have frequently portrayed him as a mysterious figure;[12][13][14] a former Enron employee, interviewed in the 2005 documentary film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, referred to Pai as \"the invisible CEO\".[15].\nThought 2: Lou Pai was a former executive of Enron.

It was led by Kenneth Lay and developed in 1985 via a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies at the time of the merger. Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, Enron employed approximately 20,600 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas, communications, and pulp and paper company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101\u00a0billion during 2000.[1] Fortune named Enron \"America's Most Innovative Company\" for six consecutive years.. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron's reported financial condition was sustained by an institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. Enron became synonymous with willful, institutional fraud and systemic corruption.\nThought 4: Enron went bankrupt on December 2, 2001. The question asks for the year the energy company went bankrupt.\nAction 4: Finish[2001]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",
