It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The search for \"Nightmares\" did not return a film.

I will start by searching for \"Blackzilians\".\nAction 1: Search[Blackzilians]\nObservation 1: The Blackzilians was a professional team of fighters in mixed martial arts, boxing, kickboxing, amateur wrestling and catch wrestling located in South Florida. The team had included former UFC champions Rashad Evans, Vitor Belfort, Eddie Alvarez and Kamaru Usman.. Owned by Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians, started when MMA fighters Jorge Santiago, Danillo Villefort, Yuri Villefort, and Gesias Cavalcante left American Top Team.[1] The name 'Blackzilians' was coined when Strikeforce Middleweight Danillo Villefort was looking through their management's website and pointed out to Robinson that every fighter (at the time) was Black or Brazilian.[2]. It was reported on September 20, 2018, that Glenn Robinson, Blackzilians founder, had died of a suspected heart attack.[3]. As of 2017, the Blackzilians as a gym is considered defunct.[4][5] Many of its members have left to join Combat Club, now Kill Cliff Fight Club (founded by Blackzilians trainers Henri Hooft and Greg Jones) which is considered a successor to the Blackzilians.[5].\nThought 2: The observation mentions several fighters who were part of the Blackzilians, including Kamaru Usman.

As a freestyle wrestler, Usman primarily competed at 84 kilograms (185\u00a0lb), and was a 2010 U.S.\nThought 3: Kamaru Usman currently competes in the Welterweight division, not the Middleweight division. The question asks for a fighter in the Middleweight division. I need to check other fighters mentioned in the first observation. The first observation mentions Vitor Belfort. I will search for Vitor Belfort and check his division.\nAction 3: Search[Vitor Belfort]\nObservation 3: V\u00edtor Vieira Belfort[4] (Portuguese pronunciation: [\u02c8vito\u0281 vi\u02c8ej\u027e\u0250 b\u025bw\u02c8f\u0254\u0281]; born 1 April 1977) is a Brazilian professional boxer and retired mixed martial artist who competed for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he fought in the Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, and Middleweight divisions.

Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Belfort began training in boxing at the age of 12 under Claudio Coelho. Belfort later studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Carlson Gracie, who gave him his black belt.\nThought 4: Vitor Belfort competed in the Middleweight division. The question asks which \"Blackzilians\" fighter is currently competing in the Middleweight division. The observation states Vitor Belfort is a retired mixed martial artist. Therefore, he is not currently competing. I need to check other fighters mentioned in the first observation. The first observation mentions Eddie Alvarez. I will search for Eddie Alvarez and check his division.\nAction 4: Search[Eddie Alvarez]\nObservation 4: Edward Alvarez[3] (born January 11, 1984) is an American professional mixed martial artist and bare-knuckle boxer who most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC.[4] He also formerly competed in the UFC and Bellator MMA, and also ONE FC winning world titles in each of the first two: the UFC Lightweight Championship once and the Bellator Lightweight World Championship twice. Alvarez was the first Lightweight champion in Bellator MMA. He has also competed for the Japanese DREAM promotion, where he fought in their inaugural Lightweight Grand Prix. Alvarez also fought once for ProElite's EliteXC.. Alvarez is the first fighter to have won championships in both Bellator MMA and the UFC.\nThought 5: Eddie Alvarez most recently competed in the Welterweight division of BKFC and formerly competed in the UFC and Bellator MMA. He is not currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. I need to check the last fighter mentioned in the first observation, which is Rashad Evans. I will search for Rashad Evans and check his division.\nAction 5: Search[Rashad Evans]\nObservation 5: Rashad Evans (born September 25, 1979) is an American retired mixed martial artist who competed in the Light Heavyweight division.

He is not currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. Since all the fighters mentioned in the first observation have been checked and none of them are currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC, I will search for other prominent fighters associated with Blackzilians. I will search for \"Blackzilians fighters\" to see if there are other fighters I can check.\nAction 6: Search\nObservation 6: Invalid action: search\nThought 7: The previous action was invalid. I need to search for \"Blackzilians fighters\" to find more information.\nAction 7: Search[Blackzilians fighters]\nObservation 7: Could not find Blackzilians fighters.

This article about a location in the Mexican state of Sinaloa is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Villa Uni\u00f3n is located in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, but it does not state that the state was named after the town. I need to find out if there is a Mexican state named Villa Uni\u00f3n, or if Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. Since the question asks \"Were was the Mexican state after which there is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located?\", it implies that Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\nAction 2: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n]\nObservation 2: Villa Uni\u00f3n is a city in northwestern Argentina and the main settlement of Coronel Felipe Varela Department with a population of 12,263..

Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 3: The observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" refers to a city in Argentina, not a Mexican state. The previous observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" stated it is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The question asks for the Mexican state *after which* Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is located.

It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast. To the west, Sinaloa faces Baja California Sur, across the Gulf of California.

It only states that Sinaloa is a state in Mexico. The question asks \"Were was the Mexican state after which there is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located?\". This phrasing is confusing. It could mean \"What Mexican state is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located in?\" or \"What Mexican state is named after Villa Uni\u00f3n?\".

If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n If the question is based on a false premise or the information needed to answer is not available, answer \"null\".\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 \u2013 June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-\u0080\u00931846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: What language, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages?\nThought 1: I need to find the language that is traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script and is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages. I will start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\".\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The search result mentions that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, specifically mentioning the Numidian language. It also states that the origin of the script is debated, with theories suggesting it's a modified version of the Phoenician alphabet or a local invention influenced by it. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and traditionally written with the Libyco-Berber script. The current observation mentions \"\nAction 2: Lookup[Tumzabt]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Libyco-Berber script\" mentioned \"ancient varieties of the Berber language\" and \"Numidian language\". It also mentioned that the script evolved into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I need to find a connection between these languages and the information I have. I will search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to see if they are related to\nAction 3: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 3: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 4: The search result for \"Tumzabt\" states that it is also known as Mozabite or Ghardaia, and it is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites in Algeria. It also mentions that Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. I have found that Tumzabt is a Berber\nAction 4: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 4: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 5: The search results for Tumzabt and Teggargrent indicate that they are both Zenati Berber languages spoken in Algeria. The search result for Teggargrent also mentions that speakers from Ouargla (which is related to Teggargrent) consider Tumzabt/Mozabite and other Zenati varieties as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit. The initial search for Libyco-Berber script mentioned that it was used to write \"ancient varieties of the Berber\nAction 5: Lookup[Berber language]\nObservation 5: (Result 1 / 2) Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language.\nThought 6: The search results indicate that Tumzabt and Teggargrent are both Zenati Berber languages. The first search result for \"Libyco-Berber script\" mentioned that it was used to write \"ancient varieties of the Berber language\". The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Ber\nAction 6: Lookup[related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: The search results for Tumzabt and Teggargrent indicate they are both Zenati Berber languages. The first search result for \"Libyco-Berber script\" mentioned it was used to write \"ancient varieties of the Berber language\". The question asks for a language closely related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Ber\nAction 7: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 7: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\n",
