It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 3: The question asks which Captain launched the attack that led to more casualties than any other incident in the war between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape. The observation states that Kieft's War (1643-1645) was a conflict between New Netherland and the Lenape. It also mentions that Willem Kieft ordered an attack without approval, and that Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred inhabitants. This suggests Willem Kieft was involved in a significant attack.\nAction 3: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 7) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 4: The observation states that Willem Kieft ordered an attack and that Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred inhabitants. This attack is described as leading to unification among tribes and waves of attacks on both sides, implying significant casualties. The question asks for the Captain who launched the attack with the most casualties. While the observation doesn't explicitly state this was the *most* casualties, it describes a massacre and widespread conflict initiated by Kieft's order. Therefore, Willem Kieft is the most likely\nAction 4: Finish[Willem Kieft]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The search for \"Nightmares\" did not return a film.

The film is made up of four short films based on urban legends; the first concerns a woman who encounters a killer in the backseat of her car; the second concerns a video game-addicted teenager who is consumed by his game; the third focuses on a fallen priest who is stalked by a pickup truck from hell; and the last follows a suburban family battling a giant rat in their home.[3]. Nightmares was originally filmed as a two-hour pilot of a proposed television series to be broadcast by the NBC network during the 1983\u20131984 TV season.. During a routine traffic stop, a highway patrolman is viciously stabbed by an unseen assailant, though he survives and is taken to the hospital. The perpetrator is William Henry Glazier, a serial killer who escaped a mental institution and is currently terrorizing the Topanga area..\nThought 4: The film \"Nightmares (1983 film)\" was released in 1983 and stars Emilio Estevez. The question asks for a film Emilio Estevez starred in in the same year as \"Nightmares\".

The concert run featured 76 shows across four continents, starting at Glasgow's SEC Centre on 3 December 2011 and ending at New York City's Barclays Center on 31 December 2012.[3] A visit to Latin America was originally set for 2013, later being cancelled.. Prior to the tour, the band embarked on a series of promotional and festival performances, including Austin City Limits,[4] Glastonbury,[5] Lollapalooza,[6] and Rock in Rio.[7] Coldplay held concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well.[8] They became the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows,[9] popularising them in the live music industry.[10] According to Pollstar, the tour grossed over $181.3 million from 2.1 million tickets sold across 75 reported dates.[11].

None of them are currently competing in the Middleweight division of the UFC. The initial search for \"Blackzilians\" did not mention any other fighters. It's possible that no current Blackzilians fighter is in the Middleweight division, or the information is not readily available.

I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" and look for information about its naming.\nAction 1: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa]\nObservation 1: Villa Uni\u00f3n is the second largest town in the municipality of Mazatl\u00e1n, after the port of Mazatl\u00e1n. It is located twenty kilometers south of the city on the banks of the Presidio River.. To the south of the town lies El Walamo, and El Roble lies to the north.. This article about a location in the Mexican state of Sinaloa is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Villa Uni\u00f3n is located in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, but it does not state that the state was named after the town. I need to find out if there is a Mexican state named Villa Uni\u00f3n, or if Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. Since the question asks \"Were was the Mexican state after which there is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located?\", it implies that Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\nAction 2: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n]\nObservation 2: Villa Uni\u00f3n is a city in northwestern Argentina and the main settlement of Coronel Felipe Varela Department with a population of 12,263.. The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 3: The observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" refers to a city in Argentina, not a Mexican state. The previous observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" stated it is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The question asks for the Mexican state *after which* Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is located. This implies Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. However, the information found so far suggests the opposite: Villa Uni\u00f3n is *in* Sinaloa. I need to find out if there\nAction 3: Search[Sinaloa]\nObservation 3: Sinaloa (Spanish pronunciation: [sina\u02c8loa] \u24d8), officially the Estado Libre y Soberano de Sinaloa (English: Free and Sovereign State of Sinaloa), is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, compose the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 18 municipalities, and its capital city is Culiac\u00e1n Rosales.. It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast. To the west, Sinaloa faces Baja California Sur, across the Gulf of California.

I will start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\".\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The search result mentions that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, specifically mentioning the Numidian language. It also states that the origin of the script is debated, with theories suggesting it's a modified version of the Phoenician alphabet or a local invention influenced by it. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and traditionally written with the Libyco-Berber script. The current observation mentions \"\nAction 2: Lookup[Tumzabt]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Libyco-Berber script\" mentioned \"ancient varieties of the Berber language\" and \"Numidian language\". It also mentioned that the script evolved into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent. I need to find a connection between these languages and the information I have. I will search for \"Tumzabt\" and \"Teggargrent\" to see if they are related to\nAction 3: Search[Tumzabt]\nObservation 3: Mozabite (endonym: tamazight), also known as Mzab, Tum\u1e93abt or Ghardaia, is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group inhabiting the seven cities of the M'zab natural region in the northern Saharan Algeria.[2][3][4] It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 4: The search result for \"Tumzabt\" states that it is also known as Mozabite or Ghardaia, and it is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites in Algeria. It also mentions that Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script. I have found that Tumzabt is a Berber\nAction 4: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 4: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 5: The search results for Tumzabt and Teggargrent indicate that they are both Zenati Berber languages spoken in Algeria. The search result for Teggargrent also mentions that speakers from Ouargla (which is related to Teggargrent) consider Tumzabt/Mozabite and other Zenati varieties as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.

Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Ber\nAction 7: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 7: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\n",

Surface water may be present, or water may only be accessible from wells or underground channels created by humans. In geography, an oasis may be a current or past rest stop on a transportation route, or less-than-verdant location that nonetheless provides access to underground water through deep wells created and maintained by humans. Although they depend on a natural condition, such as the presence of water that may be stored in reservoirs and used for irrigation, most oases, as we know them, are artificial.[2]. The word oasis came into English from Latin: oasis, from Ancient Greek: \u1f44\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \u00f3asis, which in turn is a direct borrowing from Demotic Egyptian.\nThought 2: The search for \"Oasis\" returned information about the geographical term, not the band. I need to search for the band \"Oasis\".\nAction 2: Search[Oasis (band)]\nObservation 2: Oasis are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam asked his older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became the de facto leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four studio albums.[1][2] They are regarded as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the Britpop genre.[3]. Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut studio album Definitely Maybe (1994), which topped the UK Albums Chart and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time.\nThought 3: The observation mentions Tony McCarroll as the drummer. The question states that the hit single had an acoustic debut in Tony McCarroll's last concert. I need to find which Oasis song had its acoustic debut at Tony McCarroll's last concert. I will look for information about Tony McCarroll's departure from Oasis and any associated concerts.\nAction 3: Lookup[Tony McCarroll]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 5) The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums).\nThought 4: The observation mentions Tony McCarroll as the drummer but doesn't provide information about his last concert or any song debuts.

I will try to find which of these\nAction 7: Search[Live Forever (Oasis song)]\nObservation 7: \"Live Forever\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis. Written by Noel Gallagher, the song was released as the third single from their debut album Definitely Maybe (1994) on 8 August 1994, by Creation Records, just prior to that album's release.[3][4] Inspired by the Rolling Stones' \"Shine a Light\", \"Live Forever\" features a basic song structure and lyrics with an optimistic outlook that contrasted with the attitude of the grunge bands popular at the time. Two different music videos were produced to accompany it, directed by Carlos Grasso and Nick Egan. The song was the first Oasis single to enter the top ten in the United Kingdom, and garnered critical acclaim. In 2017, lead singer Liam Gallagher declared it his favourite Oasis song.[5] The British Phonographic Industry certified the song triple platinum in July 2024.[6] Upon Oasis' reunion in August 2024, the song reached a new peak of number eight on the UK Singles Chart.[7].\n",

Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.[3]. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric, grammar, and logic, and the quadrivium of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music.\n",

The six regions widely considered Celtic countries in modern times are Brittany (Breizh), Cornwall (Kernow), Ireland (\u00c9ire), the Isle of Man (Mannin, or Ellan Vannin), Scotland (Alba), and Wales (Cymru).[1][3] In each of these six regions a Celtic language is spoken to some extent: Brittonic or Brythonic languages are spoken in Brittany (Breton), Cornwall (Cornish), and Wales (Welsh), whilst Goidelic or Gaelic languages are spoken in Scotland (Scottish Gaelic), Ireland (Irish), and the Isle of Man (Manx).[4]. Before the expansion of ancient Rome and the spread of Germanic and Slavic tribes, much of Europe was dominated by Celtic-speaking cultures, leaving behind a legacy of Celtic cultural traits.[5] Certain regions with evidence of Celtic influence in northwestern Iberia, such as Galicia, Asturias, northern Portugal, Le\u00f3n, and Cantabria (historically known as Gallaecia and Astures), are not typically considered Celtic nations.[6] Unlike the Insular Celtic languages, there's no record of Celtic languages surviving into the modern era in these regions.[6][7][8] Similar evidence of a pattern of Celtic influence without the long-term survival of Celtic languages is also found in various regions across Europe, including parts of Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic.. The concept of the Celtic nations is widely promoted by pan-Celtic movements, including political and cultural organizations like the Celtic League or International Celtic Congress..
