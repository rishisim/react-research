I will start by searching for \"New Netherland Lenape war\".\nAction 1: Search[New Netherland Lenape war]\nObservation 1: Could not find New Netherland Lenape war. Similar: ['Lenape', 'New Netherland', \"Kieft's War\", 'New York (state)', 'Pavonia, New Netherland'].\nThought 2: The search for \"New Netherland Lenape war\" did not yield direct results. However, the similar entities suggest \"Kieft's War\" might be relevant. I will search for \"Kieft's War\" to gather information about the conflict and its casualties.\nAction 2: Search[Kieft's War]\nObservation 2: Kieft's War (1643\u20131645), also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict between the colonial province of New Netherland and the Wappinger and Lenape Indians in what is now New York and New Jersey. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between settlers and Indians in the region. The Dutch West India Company was displeased with Kieft and recalled him, but he died in a shipwreck while returning to the Netherlands; Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands because of the continuing threat from the Algonquians, and growth slowed in the colony..\nThought 3: The question asks which Captain launched the attack that led to more casualties than any other incident in the war between New Netherland settlers and the Lenape. The observation states that Willem Kieft ordered an attack without approval, and this attack led to Dutch colonists massacring inhabitants of Lenape camps. This event precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. The question asks for a \"Captain\", and Willem Kieft was the Director-General of New Netherland. It's possible \"Captain\" is used loosely\nAction 3: Lookup[attack]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 7) It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without the approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.[2] Dutch colonists attacked Lenape camps and massacred the inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.\nThought 4: The observation states that Willem Kieft ordered an attack that led to the massacre of Lenape inhabitants. This attack is described as precipitating \"waves of attacks on both sides.\" The question asks for the \"Captain\" who launched the attack with the most casualties.

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.[2] Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.. Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.[3].\nThought 2: The search for \"Nightmares\" did not return a film. I need to find a film with that title. I will try searching for \"Nightmares film\".\nAction 2: Search[Nightmares film]\nObservation 2: Could not find Nightmares film.

The film is made up of four short films based on urban legends; the first concerns a woman who encounters a killer in the backseat of her car; the second concerns a video game-addicted teenager who is consumed by his game; the third focuses on a fallen priest who is stalked by a pickup truck from hell; and the last follows a suburban family battling a giant rat in their home.[3]. Nightmares was originally filmed as a two-hour pilot of a proposed television series to be broadcast by the NBC network during the 1983\u20131984 TV season.. During a routine traffic stop, a highway patrolman is viciously stabbed by an unseen assailant, though he survives and is taken to the hospital. The perpetrator is William Henry Glazier, a serial killer who escaped a mental institution and is currently terrorizing the Topanga area..\nThought 4: Nightmares (1983 film) was released in 1983 and stars Emilio Estevez.

The concert run featured 76 shows across four continents, starting at Glasgow's SEC Centre on 3 December 2011 and ending at New York City's Barclays Center on 31 December 2012.[3] A visit to Latin America was originally set for 2013, later being cancelled.. Prior to the tour, the band embarked on a series of promotional and festival performances, including Austin City Limits,[4] Glastonbury,[5] Lollapalooza,[6] and Rock in Rio.[7] Coldplay held concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg as well.[8] They became the first musicians to make use of LED wristbands at shows,[9] popularising them in the live music industry.[10] According to Pollstar, the tour grossed over $181.3 million from 2.1 million tickets sold across 75 reported dates.[11]. After devoting the summer of 2011 to a promotional tour in Europe, the Americas and Africa,[12] the band announced the tour via their Twitter account in September 2011.\nThought 5: The observation mentions that Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto Tour was the first to use LED wristbands and popularized them. However, it does not mention Jason Regler or the instrument that inspired the idea. I need to find a direct link between Jason Regler, the inspiration for the wristbands, a song, and an instrument. I will try searching for \"Jason Regler\" and \"Coldplay\" together, focusing on the origin of the Xyloband idea.\nAction 5: Search[Jason Regler Coldplay]\nObservation 5: Could not find Jason Regler Coldplay.

I need to find out if there is a Mexican state named Villa Uni\u00f3n, or if Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. Since the question asks \"Were was the Mexican state after which there is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located?\", it implies that Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is named after a state. I will search for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\nAction 2: Search[Villa Uni\u00f3n]\nObservation 2: Villa Uni\u00f3n is a city in northwestern Argentina and the main settlement of Coronel Felipe Varela Department with a population of 12,263.. The city is strategically located in the heart of the Bermejo Valley, 1,153 meters above sea level, at the foothills of the Andes mountains. Beautifully set midst the intense red mountain ranges of Sierra de Famatina and Sierra de Ma\u00edz, surrounded by local, traditional wineries and the Bermejo River running, often brutally in the rainy season, through the city.. The weather is hot and rainy during the summer, January and February being the wettest months, while it is dry and cold during winter. As the soil can't easily get rid of the heavy rainfall, the area commonly floods during the rainy season.\nThought 3: The observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n\" refers to a city in Argentina, not a Mexican state. The previous observation for \"Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa\" stated it is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The question asks for the Mexican state *after which* Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa is located.

It is divided into 18 municipalities, and its capital city is Culiac\u00e1n Rosales.. It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast.

It only states that Sinaloa is a state in Mexico. The question asks \"Were was the Mexican state after which there is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located?\". This phrasing is confusing. It could mean \"What Mexican state is Villa Uni\u00f3n, Sinaloa located in?\" or \"What Mexican state is named after Villa Uni\u00f3n?\".

I will start by searching for \"Libyco-Berber script\".\nAction 1: Search[Libyco-Berber script]\nObservation 1: The Libyco-Berber alphabet is an abjad writing system that was used during the first millennium BC by various Berber peoples of North Africa and the Canary Islands, to write ancient varieties of the Berber language like the Numidian language.[2][3][4][5][6]. The use of the Libyco-Berber alphabet died out in northern areas during or after the reign of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, but it spread south into the Sahara desert and evolved there into the Tuareg Tifinagh alphabet used by the Tuareg Berbers to this day.. It is also known as the Numidian script or the Old Lybian script, the point being to avoid an assumption that Numidian has any continuity with any surviving modern Berber language.[7]. The origin of the Libyco-Berber script is still debated by academic researchers.[8][9] The leading theories regarding its origins posit it as being either a heavily modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, or a local invention influenced by the latter,[10] with the most supported view being that it derived from a local prototype conceptually inspired by a Phoenician or archaic Semitic model.[11] Other unlikely explanations include Greek, Punic or South Arabian influences.[11]. One of the oldest known variants of the script is found in inscriptions in Dugga dating from Numidian times.[12][13].\nThought 2: The search result mentions that the Libyco-Berber script was used to write ancient varieties of the Berber language, specifically mentioning the Numidian language. It also states that the origin of the script is debated, with theories suggesting it's a modified version of the Phoenician alphabet or a local invention influenced by it. The question asks for a language related to Tumzabt and Teggargrent, and traditionally written with the Libyco-Berber script. The current observation mentions \"\nAction 2: Lookup[Tumzabt]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The previous search for \"Libyco-Berber script\" mentioned \"ancient varieties of the Berber language\" and \"Numidian language\".

Mozabites also use Algerian Arabic. As of 2010, UNESCO estimated there to be about 150,000 Mozabite speakers.[3]. Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages, a dialect cluster of the Zenati languages.[3]. This Algeria-related article is a stub.\nThought 4: The search result for \"Tumzabt\" states that it is also known as Mozabite or Ghardaia, and it is a Zenati language spoken by the Mozabites in Algeria. It also mentions that Mozabite is one of the Mzab\u2013Wargla languages.

I have found that Tumzabt is a Berber\nAction 4: Search[Teggargrent]\nObservation 4: Ouargli, or Teggargrent (also Twargrit, T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), is a Zenati Berber language. It is spoken in the oases of Ouargla (Wargr\u0259n) and N'Goussa (Ingusa) in Algeria.. As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.[2] Ethnologue estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.[3]. There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (T\u0259ggargr\u0259nt) and N'Goussa (T\u0259gg\u0259ngusit), notably in the position of pronominal clitics; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.[4]. Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, Tugurt/Temacine and Tumzabt/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call Twargrit.[5] According to Delheure (1987:355), at Wargr\u0259n f\u0259hh\u0259m\u0259n d aw\u0259\u1e25di tawsint, \"the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well.\".\nThought 5: The search results for Tumzabt and Teggargrent indicate that they are both Zenati Berber languages spoken in Algeria.

Since Tumzabt and Teggargrent are Berber languages, and the Libyco-Ber\nAction 7: Search[Berber languages]\nObservation 7: The Berber languages, also known as the Amazigh languages[a] or Tamazight,[b] are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1][2] They comprise a group of closely related but mostly mutually unintelligible languages[3] spoken by Berber communities, who are indigenous to North Africa.[4][5] The languages are primarily spoken and not typically written.[6] Historically, they have been written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[7][8] Today, they may also be written in the Berber Latin alphabet or the Arabic script, with Latin being the most pervasive.[9][10][11]. The Berber languages have a level of variety similar to the Romance languages, although they are sometimes referred to as a single collective language, often as \"Berber\", \"Tamazight\", or \"Amazigh\".[12][13][2][14] The languages, with a few exceptions, form a dialect continuum.[12] There is a debate as to how to best sub-categorize languages within the Berber branch.[12][15] Berber languages typically follow verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order.[16][17] Their phonological inventories are diverse.[15]. Millions of people in Morocco and Algeria natively speak a Berber language, as do smaller populations of Libya, Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.[18] There are also probably a few million speakers of Berber languages in Western Europe.[19] Tashlhiyt, Kabyle, Central Atlas Tamazight, Tarifit, and Shawiya are some of the most commonly spoken Berber languages.[18] Exact numbers are impossible to ascertain as there are few modern North African censuses that include questions on language use, and what censuses do exist have known flaws.[20]. Following independence in the 20th century, the Berber languages have been suppressed and suffered from low prestige in North Africa.[20] Recognition of the Berber languages has been growing in the 21st century, with Morocco and Algeria adding Tamazight as an official language to their constitutions in 2011 and 2016 respectively.[20][21][22]. Most Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages.[23] For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35%[24] to 46%[25] of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 44.9% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit.[26] Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/.[27] Unlike the Chadic,.\n",
