Similar: [\"Matty Healy (redirect from Matty Healy's appearance on The Adam Friedland Show)\", 'The 1975', 'George Daniel', 'Sarah Hadland', 'Alderley Edge'].\nThought 2: The search for \"Wilmslow Show\" did not yield direct results. However, the similar entities suggest a connection to music or entertainment. I will try searching for \"The 1975\" as it is a prominent result.\nAction 2: Search[The 1975]\nObservation 2: The 1975 are. an English pop rock. band formed in Wilmslow, Cheshire, in 2002.[1][2] The band consists of Matty Healy (lead vocals, guitar, primary songwriter), Adam Hann (lead guitar), Ross MacDonald (bass), and George Daniel (drums, primary producer).[3][4] The band's name was inspired by a page of scribblings found in Healy's preowned copy of On the Road by Jack Kerouac which was dated \"1 June, The 1975\".. The band members met in secondary school and first performed together as teenagers in 2002, before professionally releasing music in 2012 under the independent label Dirty Hit.[5] From 2012 to 2013, they opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays\u2014Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, and IV\u2014before releasing their UK chart-topping self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles \"Sex\", \"Chocolate\", and \"Robbers\".. All of the band's albums hit No.\nThought 3: The previous search for \"The 1975\" mentions that the band formed in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and that the band members met in secondary school. This suggests that the Wilmslow Show might be related to a school in Wilmslow. I will try to find information about schools in Wilmslow that might host such an event. Since the show is not directly found, I will search for \"schools in Wilmslow\".\nAction 3: Search[schools in\nObservation 3: Invalid action: search[schools in\nThought 4: The previous action was invalid because it was incomplete.

A girls' grammar school was built on 14 acres (57,000\u00a0m2) of the former Colshaw Hall Farm, and situated on Dean Row Road. It opened in 1964 and housed 750 girls.\nThought 6: The observation states that Wilmslow High School was originally established as \"Wilmslow County Grammar School\". This is a designation for the school. The question asks for the designation of the school where the Wilmslow Show is held. Given the previous steps, it's highly probable that Wilmslow High School is the venue. Therefore, its original designation is the answer.\nAction 6: Finish[Wilmslow County Grammar School]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",
