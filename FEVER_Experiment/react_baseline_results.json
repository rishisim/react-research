A monk (/m\u028c\u014bk/; from Greek: \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2, monachos, \"single, solitary\" via Latin monachus)[1][2] is a man who is a member of a religious order and lives in a monastery.[3] A monk usually lives his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy across numerous cultures.. The Greek word for \"monk\" may be applied to men or women. In English, however, \"monk\" is applied mainly to men, while nun is typically used for female monastics..\nThought 2: The observation states that a monk \"usually lives his life in prayer and contemplation.\" This does not directly mention abstinence from worldly sins. While prayer and contemplation might imply a detachment from worldly matters, it doesn't explicitly confirm abstinence from \"worldly sins.\" Therefore, there is not enough information to support or refute the claim.\nAction 2: Finish[NOT ENOUGH INFO]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",
