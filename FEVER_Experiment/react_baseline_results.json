Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]. Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]. Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world.[1] Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common.[1] In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.[1] Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission.[1][12] As of 2016[update], only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms.[13][14] However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA).[15] Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result..\nThought 2: The observation states that \"Rabies is a viral disease\". This directly supports the claim that Rabies is a disease.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",

The complex is the largest palace erected in Europe during the 18th century.[2] In 1997, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site;[3] its nomination described it as \"the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space\".[2] The Royal Palace of Caserta is the largest former royal residence in the world,[2][4] over 2 million m3 in volume[5] covering an area of 47,000 m2[6] and a floorspace of 138,000 square metres distributed across five floors.[7]. The construction of the palace began in 1752[2] for Charles VII of Naples (later Charles III of Spain), who worked closely with his architect, Luigi Vanvitelli.[8] When Charles saw Vanvitelli's grandly scaled model for Caserta, it filled him with emotion \"fit to tear his heart from his breast.\"[9] In the end, Charles never slept a night at the Reggia, as he abdicated in 1759 to become King of Spain.[8] The project was carried to only partial completion for Charles' third son and successor, Ferdinand IV of Naples.. The political and social model for Vanvitelli's palace was Versailles, which, though strikingly different in its variety and disposition, solved similar problems of assembling and providing for the king, court, and government in a massive building with the social structure of a small city, confronting a baroque view of a highly subordinated nature, la nature forc\u00e9e.[10] This was part of the entire concept of the palace when Mario Gioffredo first proposed it in 1750.

His work has been characterized by a strong connection to fairy tales, gothicism and horror often blending the genres, with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty in the grotesque.[1] He has had a lifelong fascination with monsters, which he considers symbols of great power.[2] He is known for pioneering dark fantasy in the film industry and for his use of insectile and religious imagery, his themes of Catholicism, celebrating imperfection, underworld motifs, practical special effects, and dominant amber lighting.[3][4][5]. Throughout his career, del Toro has shifted between Spanish-language films\u2014such as Cronos (1993), The Devil's Backbone (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006)\u2014and English-language films, including Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), Hellboy (2004) and its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Pacific Rim (2013), Crimson Peak (2015), The Shape of Water (2017), Nightmare Alley (2021), and Pinocchio (2022)..

House was created and pioneered by DJs and producers in Chicago such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Joe Smooth, Steve \"Silk\" Hurley, Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and others. House music initially expanded to New York City, then internationally to cities such as London, and ultimately became a worldwide phenomenon.[14]. House has a large influence on pop music, especially dance music. It was incorporated into works by major international artists including Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Pet Shop Boys, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, and produced many mainstream hits such as \"Pump Up the Jam\" by Technotronic, \"French Kiss\" by Lil Louis, \"Show Me Love\" by Robin S., and \"Push the Feeling On\" by the Nightcrawlers.\nThought 4: Observation 3 describes the genre of \"House\" music and its origins, but it does not mention the TV show \"House\" or any actors performing music for it.
