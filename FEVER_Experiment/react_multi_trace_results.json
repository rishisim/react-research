Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican traditions as well as in other faiths such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.[1] In other religions, monasticism is generally criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in modern Judaism.. Many monastics live in abbeys, convents, monasteries, or priories to separate themselves from the secular world, unless they are in mendicant or missionary orders.. The Sangha or community of ordained Buddhist bhikkhus (Pali bhikkhu, like Sanskrit bhik\u1e63u, means 'mendicant; one who lives by alms'[2]), and original bhikkhun\u012bs (nuns) were founded by the Buddha during his lifetime over 2500 years ago. This communal monastic lifestyle grew out of the lifestyle of earlier sects of wandering ascetics, some of whom the Buddha had studied under.\nThought 4: Observation 3 mentions that monasticism is \"a religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual activities.\" This directly supports the claim that a monk practices a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly sins, as renouncing worldly pursuits is synonymous with abstaining from worldly sins.\nAction 4: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

In the Christian tradition, such public vows are made by the religious\u00a0\u2013  cenobitic and eremitic\u00a0\u2013  of the Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience or Benedictine equivalent.
