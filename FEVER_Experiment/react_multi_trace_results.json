The lives of all Buddhist monastics are governed by a set of rules called the pr\u0101timok\u1e63a or p\u0101timokkha.[1] Their lifestyles are shaped to support their spiritual practice: to live a simple and meditative life and attain nirvana.[3]. A person under the age of 20 cannot be ordained as a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni but can be ordained as a \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era or \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47\u0113r\u012b.. Bhikkhu literally means \"beggar\" or \"one who lives by alms\".[4] The historical Buddha, Prince Siddhartha, having abandoned a life of pleasure and status, lived as an alms mendicant as part of his \u015brama\u1e47a lifestyle. Those of his more serious students who renounced their lives as householders and came to study full-time under his supervision also adopted this lifestyle.\nThought 4: The observation states that a bhikkhu's lifestyle is shaped to support their spiritual practice: to live a simple and meditative life and attain nirvana. It also mentions that the historical Buddha abandoned a life of pleasure and status. While it doesn't explicitly use the phrase \"abstinence from worldly sins,\" a simple and meditative life, and abandoning a life of pleasure and status, strongly imply such abstinence.

Melancholy was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.[3] Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common cause\u00a0\u2013 an excess of a notional fluid known as \"black bile\", which was commonly linked to the spleen. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians described melancholia as a distinct disease with mental and physical symptoms, including persistent fears and despondencies, poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, and agitation.[4][5] Later, fixed delusions were added by Galen and other physicians to the list of symptoms.[6][7] In the Middle Ages, the understanding of melancholia shifted to a religious perspective,[8][9] with sadness seen as a vice and demonic possession, rather than somatic causes, as a potential cause of the disease.[10]. During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a cultural and literary cult of melancholia emerged in England, linked to Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino's transformation of melancholia from a sign of vice into a mark of genius. This fashionable melancholy became a prominent theme in literature, art, and music of the era.[citation needed].\nThought 6: The search for \"Melancholia\" did not yield information about the film or its director.

The film's story revolves around two sisters, one of whom marries just before a rogue planet is about to collide with Earth. Melancholia is the second film in von Trier's unofficially titled Depression Trilogy. It was preceded in 2009 by Antichrist and followed by Nymphomaniac in 2013.[5]. On 18 May 2011, Melancholia premiered at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and Dunst won the festival's Best Actress Award for her performance, which was a common area of praise among critics.[6] Many critics and film scholars have considered the film to be a masterpiece.\nThought 8: Agent did not finish.

Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]. Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]. Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world.[1] Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common.[1] In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.[1] Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission.[1][12] As of 2016[update], only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms.[13][14] However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA).[15] Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result..\nThought 2: The observation clearly states that \"Rabies is a viral disease\".

Founded in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[10]. Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court, the governing legislature of colonial-era Massachusetts Bay Colony.[11] While never formally affiliated with any denomination, Harvard trained Congregational clergy until its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th century.. By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[12][13] Following the American Civil War, under Harvard president Charles William Eliot's long tenure from 1869 to 1909, Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it into a modern research university.\nThought 4: The search results for Harvard University do not mention its size in square feet.

Sleipnir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin's steed, is the child of Loki and Sva\u00f0ilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel. The Prose Edda contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and details that he is grey in color.. Sleipnir is also mentioned in a riddle found in the 13th-century legendary saga Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks, in the 13th-century legendary saga V\u00f6lsunga saga as the ancestor of the horse Grani, and book I of Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, contains an episode considered by many scholars to involve Sleipnir.\nThought 2: The observation states that Sleipnir is an \"eight-legged horse\".

He graduated from the Danish National School of Performing Arts in Copenhagen in 1993,[1] and had his breakthrough role in Denmark with the film Nightwatch (1994). He played Jaime Lannister in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.. Coster-Waldau has appeared in numerous films in his native Denmark and Scandinavia, including Headhunters (2011) and A Thousand Times Good Night (2013). In the U.S, his debut film role was in the war film Black Hawk Down (2001), playing Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon.[2] He then played a detective in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam (2008), and appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality, originally intended as a pilot.\nThought 2: Because he \"appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality\", he should have worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\n\nClaim: Stranger Things is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\nThought 1: I should search for Stranger Things, and see if it is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\nAction 1: Search[Stranger Things]\nObservation 1: Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by the Duffer Brothers.

Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213\u00a0km (132\u00a0mi) by road from Brussels and 209\u00a0km (130\u00a0mi) from Cologne.[1] The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.. As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02024[update], Luxembourg City has a population of 136,208 inhabitants,[2] which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette).

The name literally means \"Law Thing\"\u2014that is, a law assembly\u2014and derives from Old Norse l\u01ebg\u00feing, which was a name given to ancient assemblies. A ting or \u00feing has existed on the Faroe Islands for over a millennium and the L\u00f8gting was the highest authority on the islands in the Viking era. From 1274 to 1816 it functioned primarily as a judicial body, whereas the modern L\u00f8gting established in 1852 is a parliamentary assembly, which gained legislative power when home rule was introduced in 1948. Together with the Manx Tynwald and the Icelandic Al\u00feing, the L\u00f8gting is one of the oldest surviving parliaments in the world, all three holding lineages to the old Norse assemblies of mainland Europe..\nThought 5: The observation states that the Faroe Islands is an \"autonomous territory within the Danish Realm\".

It is possible that Brendan, an Irish monk, sailed past the islands during his North Atlantic voyage in the 6th century. He saw an 'Island of Sheep' and a 'Paradise of Birds', which some say could be the Faroes with its dense bird population and sheep. This does suggest however that other sailors had got there before him, to bring the sheep. Norsemen settled the Faroe Islands in the 9th or 10th century.\nThought 3: This observation talks about the settlement of the Faroe Islands by Norsemen, which aligns with a connection to Norway, but doesn't specify the time period or the \"Hereditary Kingdom of Norway\" as stated in the claim.

The similar results suggest a potential connection, possibly through acting. Since the claim specifically states \"reviewed,\" and the searches haven't confirmed this, I need to determine if her involvement was as an actor or reviewer.
