Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican traditions as well as in other faiths such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.[1] In other religions, monasticism is generally criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in modern Judaism.. Many monastics live in abbeys, convents, monasteries, or priories to separate themselves from the secular world, unless they are in mendicant or missionary orders.. The Sangha or community of ordained Buddhist bhikkhus (Pali bhikkhu, like Sanskrit bhik\u1e63u, means 'mendicant; one who lives by alms'[2]), and original bhikkhun\u012bs (nuns) were founded by the Buddha during his lifetime over 2500 years ago. This communal monastic lifestyle grew out of the lifestyle of earlier sects of wandering ascetics, some of whom the Buddha had studied under.\nThought 4: Observation 3 mentions that monasticism is \"a religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual activities.\" This directly supports the claim that a monk practices a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly sins, as renouncing worldly pursuits is synonymous with abstaining from worldly sins.\nAction 4: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

In the Christian tradition, such public vows are made by the religious\u00a0\u2013  cenobitic and eremitic\u00a0\u2013  of the Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience or Benedictine equivalent.

Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican traditions as well as in other faiths such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.[1] In other religions, monasticism is generally criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in modern Judaism..

This communal monastic lifestyle grew out of the lifestyle of earlier sects of wandering ascetics, some of whom the Buddha had studied under.\nThought 5: The observation states that monasticism is a \"religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual activities.\" This directly supports the claim that a monk practices a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly sins, as renouncing worldly pursuits implies abstaining from worldly sins.\nAction 5: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

Melancholy was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.[3] Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common cause\u00a0\u2013 an excess of a notional fluid known as \"black bile\", which was commonly linked to the spleen. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians described melancholia as a distinct disease with mental and physical symptoms, including persistent fears and despondencies, poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, and agitation.[4][5] Later, fixed delusions were added by Galen and other physicians to the list of symptoms.[6][7] In the Middle Ages, the understanding of melancholia shifted to a religious perspective,[8][9] with sadness seen as a vice and demonic possession, rather than somatic causes, as a potential cause of the disease.[10]. During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a cultural and literary cult of melancholia emerged in England, linked to Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino's transformation of melancholia from a sign of vice into a mark of genius. This fashionable melancholy became a prominent theme in literature, art, and music of the era.[citation needed].\nThought 2: The observation is only about the medical definition of Melancholia, not the movie.

Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), regarded WrestleMania.

Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]. Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]. Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world.[1] Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common.[1] In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.[1] Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission.[1][12] As of 2016[update], only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms.[13][14] However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA).[15] Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result..\nThought 2: The observation explicitly states that \"Rabies is a viral disease\".

Founded in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[10]. Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court, the governing legislature of colonial-era Massachusetts Bay Colony.[11] While never formally affiliated with any denomination, Harvard trained Congregational clergy until its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th century.. By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[12][13] Following the American Civil War, under Harvard president Charles William Eliot's long tenure from 1869 to 1909, Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it into a modern research university.\nThought 7: The observation does not mention the size of Harvard University in square feet or any other unit of measurement that would allow me to determine if it is a thousand square feet.
