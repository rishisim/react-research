Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican traditions as well as in other faiths such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.[1] In other religions, monasticism is generally criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in modern Judaism.. Many monastics live in abbeys, convents, monasteries, or priories to separate themselves from the secular world, unless they are in mendicant or missionary orders.. The Sangha or community of ordained Buddhist bhikkhus (Pali bhikkhu, like Sanskrit bhik\u1e63u, means 'mendicant; one who lives by alms'[2]), and original bhikkhun\u012bs (nuns) were founded by the Buddha during his lifetime over 2500 years ago. This communal monastic lifestyle grew out of the lifestyle of earlier sects of wandering ascetics, some of whom the Buddha had studied under.\nThought 4: Observation 3 mentions that monasticism is \"a religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual activities.\" This directly supports the claim that a monk practices a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly sins, as renouncing worldly pursuits is synonymous with abstaining from worldly sins.\nAction 4: Finish[SUPPORTS]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n",

In the Christian tradition, such public vows are made by the religious\u00a0\u2013  cenobitic and eremitic\u00a0\u2013  of the Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience or Benedictine equivalent.

Melancholy was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.[3] Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common cause\u00a0\u2013 an excess of a notional fluid known as \"black bile\", which was commonly linked to the spleen. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians described melancholia as a distinct disease with mental and physical symptoms, including persistent fears and despondencies, poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, and agitation.[4][5] Later, fixed delusions were added by Galen and other physicians to the list of symptoms.[6][7] In the Middle Ages, the understanding of melancholia shifted to a religious perspective,[8][9] with sadness seen as a vice and demonic possession, rather than somatic causes, as a potential cause of the disease.[10]. During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a cultural and literary cult of melancholia emerged in England, linked to Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino's transformation of melancholia from a sign of vice into a mark of genius. This fashionable melancholy became a prominent theme in literature, art, and music of the era.[citation needed].\nThought 2: The observation is only about the medical definition of Melancholia, not the movie.

Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), regarded WrestleMania. As a result, the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion.

Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]. Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]. Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world.[1] Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common.[1] In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.[1] Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission.[1][12] As of 2016[update], only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms.[13][14] However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA).[15] Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result..\nThought 2: The observation explicitly states that \"Rabies is a viral disease\".

Founded in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[10]. Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court, the governing legislature of colonial-era Massachusetts Bay Colony.[11] While never formally affiliated with any denomination, Harvard trained Congregational clergy until its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th century.. By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[12][13] Following the American Civil War, under Harvard president Charles William Eliot's long tenure from 1869 to 1909, Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it into a modern research university.\nThought 7: The observation does not mention the size of Harvard University in square feet or any other unit of measurement that would allow me to determine if it is a thousand square feet.

Sleipnir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin's steed, is the child of Loki and Sva\u00f0ilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel. The Prose Edda contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and details that he is grey in color.. Sleipnir is also mentioned in a riddle found in the 13th-century legendary saga Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks, in the 13th-century legendary saga V\u00f6lsunga saga as the ancestor of the horse Grani, and book I of Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, contains an episode considered by many scholars to involve Sleipnir.\nThought 2: The observation states that Sleipnir is an \"eight-legged horse\". The claim is that Sleipnir has eight arms. Since Sleipnir is a horse, it would have legs, not arms.

He graduated from the Danish National School of Performing Arts in Copenhagen in 1993,[1] and had his breakthrough role in Denmark with the film Nightwatch (1994). He played Jaime Lannister in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.. Coster-Waldau has appeared in numerous films in his native Denmark and Scandinavia, including Headhunters (2011) and A Thousand Times Good Night (2013). In the U.S, his debut film role was in the war film Black Hawk Down (2001), playing Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon.[2] He then played a detective in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam (2008), and appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality, originally intended as a pilot.\nThought 2: Because he \"appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality\", he should have worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\n\nClaim: Stranger Things is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\nThought 1: I should search for Stranger Things, and see if it is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\nAction 1: Search[Stranger Things]\nObservation 1: Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by the Duffer Brothers. Set in the 1980s, primarily in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series centers on a number of mysteries and supernatural events occurring around the town and their impact on an ensemble of child and adult characters. \nThought 2: The observation says that it is set in a \"fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana\", so it is not set in Bloomington.\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\n\nClaim: Beautiful reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.?\nThought 1: I need to search the song Beautiful and find if it reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.\nAction 1: Search[Beautiful]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Beautiful]. Similar: ['Beautiful', 'Beautiful, Beautiful', 'A Beautiful Mind (film)', 'Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)', 'Life Is Beautiful'].\nThought 2: From suggestions, I should search \"Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)\" to find the song.\nAction 2: Search[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)]\nObservation 2: \"Beautiful\" is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002).\nThought 3: It does not mention Billboard, so I need to look up \"Billboard Hot 100\" to find if it reached number two on it in 2003.\nAction 3: Lookup[Billboard Hot 100]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 3) The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it was certified Gold for 500,000 units shipped.\nThought 4: It only says the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, but not if it was in 2003. I am not sure if this claim is true or not.\nAction 4: Finish[NOT ENOUGH INFO]\n\nClaim: House is on ABC.\nThought 1: I need to search for the TV show \"House\" and see which network it is on.\nAction 1: Search[House TV show]\nObservation 1: House (also known as House, M.D.) is an American medical drama television series created by David Shore that originally aired on Fox from November 16, 2004, to May 21, 2012 for eight seasons. It features the life of Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, misanthropic, cynical medical genius who, despite his dependence on pain medication, successfully leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton\u2013Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights, and his flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).\nThought 2: The observation states that the show \"originally aired on Fox\". This contradicts the claim that it is on ABC.\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n",
